<h1> Doubling in <em>Midsummer</em>
</h1>
<p><em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> is a play that seems designed for extensive
        <strong>doubling</strong> by actors – that is, actors playing more than one role
    in the play. A quick glance at the Act-Scene-Character breakdown (see Appendix 1)
    reveals clear patterns of character groups that disappear from the play for
    stretches of time, while another group of characters of almost identical
    configuration replaces them. These two groups may alternate scenes throughout the
    play, but never appear onstage together. Identification of these groupings, and how
    they alternate follows:</p>
<h2>1. Athenians/Supernaturals</h2>
<p>Theseus, Hippolyta and Philostrate always appear together. They are conspicuously
    absent during the times their supernatural counterparts – Oberon, Tytania and Puck –
    hold the stage. Since Peter Brook’s groundbreaking production in 1969, it has become
    almost traditional for Theseus/Oberon to be played by a single actor,
    Hippolyta/Tytania to be played by a single actor, and Philostrate/Puck to double.
    These pairings are both theatrically entertaining and thematically resonant. (A
    number of strict traditionalists insist that this could not have been Shakespeare’s
    original intention because Oberon and Tytania exit at the end of Unit 33 while
    Theseus and Hippolyta begin Unit 34. At least on paper, this seems an unmanageable
    costume change and reëntrance. A half century of theatrical productions have devised
    so many possible solutions for this problem, ranging from ingenious quick changes,
    to insertion of a short musical interlude, to reversing the order of Units 34 and
    35, to making the change onstage in a highly theatrical manner, that this objection
    now seems pedantic and quaint.)</p>
<h2>2. Egeus/Mechanical</h2>
<p>As the lines are assigned in the quartos, Egeus appears only in the first scene and
    again briefly in the fourth act, but disappears conveniently from the play before
    the final act. This means that the actor playing this role is available to double
    one of the mechanicals, usually Quince.</p>
<p>(In the Folio, Egeus is assigned all of Philostrate’s lines from the final act, but
    the fact that this makes this small part essentially unable to double any other
    roles is just one among a number of reasons for being skeptical about the authority
    of this change of line assignments in the Folio.) </p>
<h2>3. Mechanicals/Fairies</h2>
<p>Bottom’s four companions (Flute, Snug, Snout and Starveling) are never on stage with
    the four named fairies (Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Mustardseed and Moth). The only reason
    that this is not an obvious doubling is that centuries of anachronistic practice
    have conditioned a modern audience to think of the fairies as female, and as
    children. This was not an Elizabethan idea, however. The same masque for which Inigo
    Jones designed an evocative Oberon costume (which can be seen in the List of
    Characters, above) also features a set of designs for fairies, which are quite
    clearly adult men. Although this masque is a separate theatrical work than
        <em>Midsummer,</em> it still shows that as late as a couple decades after
        <em>Midsummer</em> premiered “fairies” were still thought of as something like
    "goblins," not female children. This doubling, too, has now become rather common in
    twenty-first century productions.</p>

<p>Note: The play contains characters called “Fairy” in Unit 7, and “First and Second
    Fairies” in Unit 12, as well as a non-speaking fairy identified as the “Sentinel” in
    Units 12/13, but there is no reason to think that these are not meant to be played
    by the same actors that play the named fairies that are already onstage. They are
    not true doublings, as much as they are simply open assignments. (That is to say,
    the play does not call for a minimum of eight fairies. Four fairies can do all the
    jobs.)</p>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>Without any real issue beyond thinking through the easily-solved transition from Unit
    33 to 34, the twenty-five identified characters in the cast list can be played by
    just 13 speaking actors using the above doublings. (Non-speaking extras are
    suggested at several points in the play as courtiers to Theseus and as the followers
    and attendants of Oberon and Tytania, but these are not strictly necessary and the
    play is more often produced without them that with them in the modern theatre.)</p>
<h3>A cast might look like this:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theseus/Oberon } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hippolyta/Tytania } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philostrate/Puck } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egeus/Quince } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermia } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lysander } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demetrius } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helena } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottom } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flute/Peaseblossom } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starveling/Cobweb } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snout/Mustardseed } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snug/Moth } played by one actor</li>
</ul>
<h2>More Theatrical Choices</h2>
<p>In his wonderful book-length discussion of doubling in Shakespeare, scholar Brett
    Gamboa suggests that if one is willing to be just a bit more theatrically daring, it
    is possible for both Hermia and Helena to also triple one of the mechanical/fairy
    pairings. This is possible if the production uses body doubles in the last scene of
    the play, as they both (conveniently) do not speak after the point that they take
    their places in the gallery to watch the mechanicals perform <em>Pyramus and
        Thisbe.</em> This would bring the speaking cast down to 11, although it probably
    still requires at least two extras.</p>
<p>It is not easily possible to go further than that limit without adopting more overt
    theatrical conventions (such as actors playing two parts simultaneously) and/or
    intervening in the text much further, but it is worth noting that it is only because
    they have interjections in between scenes of <em>Pyramus and Thisbe</em> that
    Lysander and Demetrius cannot also triple mechanicals. Some modern productions have
    them do so anyway by reassigning their lines or resorting to more liberties 
    with the traditional staging and text, bringing the speaking cast down to nine.</p>
<h3>At its most extreme then, a creative casting might look like this: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theseus/Oberon } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hippolyta/Tytania } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philostrate/Puck } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egeus/Quince } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermia/Snug/Moth } played by one actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lysander/Starveling/Cobweb } played by one
        actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demetrius/Snout/Mustardseed } played by one
        actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helena/Flute/Peaseblossom } played by one
        actor</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottom } played by one actor</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, a small ensemble is not always the goal. For amateur and school
    productions, it is often useful to have a large number of roles available and it is
    not necessarily desirable to use doublings with less experienced actors.
    Professional productions, however, usually want to do so. Although it is
    economically useful to employ a smaller number of speaking actors, the better reason
    is that the play is theatrically more interesting with virtuosic displays of acting
    as a result of doubling and tripling. Further the repetition of themes of the play
    can be highlighted by thoughtful employment of actors in related roles. </p>
<p>Much about the play suggests that this was, in keeping with Elizabethan theatrical
    custom generally, the original practice. Modern performance history tells us that
    the play is now more successful and popular when performed in this manner, whether
    or not it was originally played this way.</p>
