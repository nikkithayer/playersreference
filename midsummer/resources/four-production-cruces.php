<h1>Four Production Cruces</h1>

<p>Traditional editions often dwell on textual cruces. (Academic readers will
    undoubtedly notice the intentional echoing of Harold Brooks' title, "Four Textual
    Cruces.") A crux is, according to Merriam-Webster, "an essential point requiring
    resolution." Textual questions <em>do</em> require resolution for performance.
    Editors sometimes dodge this issue by noting that there are two or more equally
    valid readings, or that no satisfactory explanation is available. Neither of these
    is useful for a theatrical performance that must place one, and only one, choice on
    the stage. Still, <em>Midsummer</em> is a good text with few problems. Brooks' title
    is a bit of a cheat since he notes that there are actually three more problematic
    areas in the text, but seven textual issues is a small number.</p>
<p>While these require resolution, they should not blind us to the much larger, looming
    performance issues, which every production must solve. Here is a brief overview of
    these issues with a short discussion of the range of possible solutions explored by
    previous productions.</p>
<p><strong>What constitutes the dream? Whose dream is it?</strong></p>
<p>The title of the play is provocative. The obvious question is: If the play is a
    dream, whose dream is it? Most literary critics avoid the question by citing Puck's
    final speech alleging that it is "our," i.e. the audience's, dream. That is not what
    Puck says, however. He says that if we have found the production offensive then we
    might imagine that it has all been a bad dream and therefore forgive it. That is not
    the same thing at all.</p>
<p>Serious productions prioritize the question of whose dream this might be. Corollary
    questions might be, "Is the whole play a dream, or are some parts dreamt and some
    parts experienced rationally?"; and "Is the dream important, or is it trivial and
    insubstantial?" The text, itself, raises these questions—particularly the latter.
    Theseus and Hippolyta have a dialogue at the beginning of Act V, in which he
    dismisses the lovers' curious experience in the woods, but Hippolyta counters that
    their collective experience "grows to something of great constancy." Both in
        <em>Midsummer</em> and many other places in the canon, dreams are challenged as
    unimportant. Romeo has this famous exchange with Mercutio, for example:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <h4 class="actor">ROMEO</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> I dreamed a dream tonight. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="actor">MERCUTIO</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span class="half-line">And so did I.</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="actor">ROMEO</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Well, what was yours? </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="actor">MERCUTIO</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span class="half-line">That dreamers often lie.</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>A few lines later, Mercutio says:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <h4 class="actor">MERCUTIO</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="half-line">True, I talk of dreams,</span></li>
        <li>Which are the children of an idle brain,</li>
        <li>Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,</li>
        <li>Which is as thin of substance as the air.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>Although many Shakespearean characters reject dreams as meaningless, the playwright
    also frequently foreshadows events with dreams of divination that later come
    true.</p>
<p>Peter Holland says that the only actual dream in the play is the one from which
    Hermia wakes in Unit 17 (II.ii), in which she images she is being attacked by a serpent. All
    other portions of the play, he asserts, are not dreams but supernatural experiences
    that actually happen. While insightful, this does not substantially answer the
    performance question. It merely shifts the semantics of the discussion from
    distinguishing between the dream portions of the play and the rational ones, to
    distinguishing the supernatural portions of the play from ordinary reality.</p>
<p>Twentieth and twenty-first century productions have found a wide range of answers to
    these questions. The play is frequently interpreted as Bottom's dream or experience,
    but it has been notably performed as Theseus' (Daniels, 1981) and Hippolyta's dream
    (Alexander, 1986) as well. Adrian Noble's 1996 film based on his 1994 theatrical
    production, seemed to imply that it was a child's (the changeling's?) dream.</p>
<p>Peter Brook's production of 1970 changed not only the reputation and critical reading
    of <em>Midsummer</em>, but arguably reinvented Shakespearean production in our time.
    He related the supernatural figures to modern psychology as the unconscious
    reflections of their conscious counterparts. In that sense, his production suggested
    the play is the collective dream of all of the human characters.</p>
<p><strong>How should the supernatural characters be conceptualized and
        portrayed?</strong></p>
<p>To the great amusement of actors, few literary questions about the play have received
    as much attention, and fierce disagreement, as the size of the fairies—with
    partisans citing lines about fairies hiding in acorns to noting that Tytania
    interacts with a full-sized Bottom. This issue is largely irrelevant on the stage
    where regularly-sized humans will portray them. Much more pressing is the question
    of what the fairies <em>are</em>, and how to capture that on the stage.</p>
<p>Because fairies don't exist outside the imagination, there can be no naturalistic
    explanation. There is no objective correlative. The fairies must be conceptualized. 
    What do they represent? </p>
<p>We don't know how they were performed in Shakespeare's own time, but given the
    all-male company and the probable necessity of extensive doubling by the adult males
    in the cast, the likelihood was that they were understood as rustic, folkloric
    figures—more like goblins and gremlins rather than what we now think the word
    "fairy" implies.</p>
<p>After the Restoration, for almost all of the next three hundred years, the fairies
    were relentlessly portrayed as sentimental balletic figures for the purposes of
    pageantry. They were included to provide spectacle. All, except Oberon and Tytania,
    were usually played by children, including Puck.</p>
<p>Peter Brook broke from this cloying tradition once and for all by imagining Oberon
    and Tytania as Theseus and Hippolyta's dream doppelgangers. Their magical abilities
    were conceived as "superhuman" skills, which were represented on stage by circus and
    acrobatic equivalents.</p>

<p> What is clear is that a wide range of possibilities exists, but strong, clear
    choices play better than vaguely romantic "Tinkerbells."</p>
<p>The fairies are clearly divided into followers of Oberon and those of Tytania. Both
    monarchs are described as having "a train" in their initial encounter. These
    retinues are often gendered, following the gender of their leader, but occasionally
    reversed. These followers are generally portrayed as siding with their respective
    leaders as they spar, but have also been successfully portrayed as involuntarily
    separated pairs yearning for their leaders' reconciliation so that they might be
    reunited with their lover in the opposite train.</p>
<p><strong>...and of what does their magic consist?</strong></p>
<p>In the same way that the fairies must be conceptualized, so must their magic be. It
    is possible, even common, to simply treat it as a plot expedient without any further
    explanation, but in performance the least interesting answer is that the magic is
    simply magic. Such an answer conveniently solves problems in the world of the play:
    things happen because they are magically induced. Since magic does not exist in our
    actual world, however, such answers mean the play doesn’t have much of interest to
    say about us or to us.</p>
<p>Some such answers are unsatisfying inside the play, as well. Does Demetrius return to
    Helena at the end of the play only because he remains under a spell? Is Tytania
    reconciled with Oberon only because he has magical powers that can cause her further
    humiliation if she does not agree to return to him? These and many other aspects of
    magic in the play not only lose interest, but ultimately detract from its meaning,
    if they are just convenient plot devices on the level of a cheaply contrived
        <em>deus ex machina.</em> If we are to understand that Bottom really did turn
    into a man-beast but learned nothing from it (or was later enchanted to completely
    forget it) both his time and ours were wasted.</p>
<p>Much more interesting performances result when the magic is treated theatrically, or
    psychologically, instead of accepting it at face value. Oberon becomes
    performatively interesting by casually asserting his invisibility in direct aside to
    the audience, rather than exiting or somehow being made less visible. (Or as a
    lighting designer once put it, “This is not the moment to turn off his
    followspot, it is the moment to make it twice as bright.)</p>
<p>The subsequent scene (Unit 10) is much funnier if Oberon actively intervenes in it,
    and the actors playing Helena and Demetrius must theatrically “not see” him, than if
    he simply stands aside and watches it.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is easy for the actors to simply lie “sleeping” on the ground as Oberon
    and Puck enchant their eyes, but it is theatrically far more compelling when they
    respond physically. Most modern productions, in fact, have them shift dramatically,
    sometimes rising all the way to their feet as if sleep walking, before lying back
    down again. It is the very fact that these actions are obviously illusions being
    created by actors (of which their underlying characters are “unaware”) as opposed
    to abstract fictions to be accepted without question, that creates the theatrical
    pleasure. Suspending our disbelief is half the fun.</p>

</div>
<p>This question is pushed to its fullest when considering what it means for the
    characters in the play to be magically induced to “fall in love.” The teenagers in
    the play, after all, pair into couples, split up, recombine, and reconcile in ways
    that look only slightly exaggerated in comparison to real life adolescent behavior.
    (I can anecdotally attest that more than one school cast of the play has had
    off-stage romantic complications that were at least as byzantine as the onstage ones
    with no discernable magic involved.) Productions can make it clear to us that more
    is going on than just “magic flower juice” in a variety of ways, but almost any
    explanation—in the actors’ minds or the physical staging of the play—is more
    interesting than a mechanical execution of the stage directions that takes the
    existence of magic for granted.</p>
<p>The play treats the complications of love and lust seriously, and as essential
    components of the human condition. A good performance must do more than treat them
    as after-effects of magical interventions. </p>
<p><strong>How should the changeling be represented?</strong></p>
<p>The central conflict of <em>Midsummer</em> is a fundamentally unexplained quarrel
    between Oberon and Tytania over the possession of a changeling child. When reading
    the play this is no more insubstantial than any other element of the plot, but on
    the stage it can be frustratingly abstract if the changeling has no physical
    presence comparable to the speaking characters. Nothing in the script compels his
    appearance, since he is not directly referenced as present in the scene introducing
    the conflict, and its final resolution happens offstage. Without placing him on
    stage in some form, however, the plot often loses coherence to a contemporary
    audience more attuned to visual rather than verbal representation.</p>
<p>In folklore, changelings were misshapen fairy children substituted in the birth crib
    for beautiful human children, a proto-explanation for birth defects and
    developmental difficulties. Stories about these exchanged children abound in early
    modern literature, focusing on the fairy children wreaking havoc on the human world.
        <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> is the only case in which we see the human
    child adopted into the fairy world. Shakespeare also seems to have invented a
    benevolent reason for the exchange rather than attributing it to supernatural
    malice.</p>
<p>Because the folk sources emphasize the exchange at birth, the changeling is often
    represented in production as a baby in swaddling. This is the simplest production
    solution, since it does not require a real child, but introduces the dubious
    implication that Oberon wants to undertake infant care. </p>
<p>The still accessible 1982 production from the New York Shakespeare Festival in
    Central Park (recorded for the A&amp;E network) starring William Hurt as Oberon,
    memorably introduced child actor Emmanuel Lewis as a toddler changeling. The premise
    that Oberon might be willing to undertake raising the child, now out of diapers,
    seems more plausible but still raises questions about the nature of the conflict. </p>
<p>Liviu Ciulei's 1985 production for the Guthrie Theatre featured an adolescent
    changeling, who had grown enough to be an object of affection for Tytania. This made
    explicit the reason for Oberon's jealousy. Nothing in the play suggests how long ago
    the exchange Tytania describes took place, so it is possible for the boy to be older
    now. It certainly makes more sense of the idea that Oberon wants him for a "knight
    of his train." In this case the boy was also somewhat feminized but reappeared at
    the end of the evening at Oberon's side in a smaller duplicate of his armor,
    suggesting the conflict was about Oberon's will that (for good or ill) he be
    incorporated into the masculine sphere now that he was "of age." </p>
<p><strong>The Gender Politics of the Play</strong></p>
<p>All of Shakespeare's plays assume the gender norms of his time, even if they also
    question them in the voice of some characters. The inciting conflict of this play is
    built around a most extreme version of patriarchy, namely that Egeus "owns" his
    daughter completely, and may therefore select her husband or demand her execution.
    It is an extraordinarily rare contemporary production that does not interrogate the
    male privilege of Shakespeare's period. They usually do so emphasizing aspects of
    the play that challenge, or can be used to rethink, patriarchy.</p>
<p>Hermia's situation is often associated with that of Hippolyta, who enjoys higher
    status and possibly more freedom. In mythology Hippolyta was the captured queen of
    the independent Amazons, a band of female warriors that disempowered or eliminated
    their sons. Her marriage to Theseus was involuntary. Shakespeare refers to this
    situation at the play's outset but gives only slight indications that it has not
    resolved into a love match before the play's beginning.</p>
<p>Those "slight indications," however, are generally emphasized in modern production.
    Although at the beginning of the play Theseus says he cannot override the
    patriarchal rights enshrined in law, he eventually does just that. The inception of
    his journey toward doing so is often related to Hippolyta's apparent anger and
    frustration at the lack of justice shown in Hermia's trial. Because she has no lines
    to express that dissatisfaction, it is portrayed through behavior. </p>
<p>Hippolyta can be conceptualized as everything from a literal prisoner in a cage (John
    Hancock, 1966, San Francisco Actors' Workshop) to an early modern noblewoman
    resembling Queen Elizabeth. (Peter Hall, 2010, Rose Theatre, Kingston) Her reactions
    in the first scene may range from the growling of a caged animal, to restrained
    glowering, to faintness brought on by shock, depending on how her character is
    portrayed and how the circumstances that begin the play are imagined.</p>
<p>The frequent doubling of Oberon and Theseus can make explicit the idea that Oberon's
    encounters with Tytania constitute a kind of continuity with Theseus' experience and
    lead ultimately to Theseus' undoing of the patriarchal stifling of Hermia's love. In
    productions that do not use doubling, the same implication may be made in other
    ways.</p>
<p>The doubling of Tytania with Hippolyta also intensifies the challenge to patriarchal
    assumptions of the play. In the dream world males seem far less privileged in the
    first place. Tytania is obviously equal to Oberon in power, as he must trick her to
    get his way rather than issue an order or overpower her. In the many source stories
    of fairy queens, she is always portrayed as more powerful than her consort, if a
    counterpart to Oberon exists in them at all. She is thoroughly identified with the
    triple moon goddess Phoebe/Diana/Proserpina—sometimes as another identity—but
    Oberon is never directly associated with the Sun God, Phoebus Apollo. Although he
    does not make this explicit in the play, Shakespeare probably shared the assumption
    that rulers of the supernatural world were goddesses, and the fairy queen was a part
    of that godhead.</p>
<p>While the script does not overturn male dominance at its end—a situation not helped
    by the fact that Hermia and Helena do not speak during the final act of the play—
  productions sometimes do so. Hippolyta's viewpoint is treated as civilizing Theseus.
    She is often portrayed as prompting his kindnesses to the well-intentioned but
    bumbling players, for example. Unlike the opening scene, Theseus often makes
    elaborate shows of deference to her and her wishes at the play's end.</p>
<p>Tytania's participation in the final blessing of the marriage is also strengthened in
    many productions. Oberon is often treated as a narrator, while Tytania is seen
    performing the rites that constitute the blessing. Occasionally, some of his lines
    are simply reassigned to her to make the ending more equal.</p>
