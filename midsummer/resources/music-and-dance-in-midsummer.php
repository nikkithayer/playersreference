<h1>Music and Dance in <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em></h1>
<h2>The Performing Arts of Elizabethan England.</h2>
<p>Both music and dance were important to country life in early modern England. Folk
    dancing served as the basis for almost all community celebrations, while music
    making was the most common form of entertainment in daily life. Both art forms were
    also central to life at court where they served aesthetic purposes; but were also
    extensively employed symbolically to promote social harmony and signal political
    allegiance to the crown. Both music and dance were widely understood as metaphors
    for cosmic and earthly order.</p>
<p>Both art forms were also integral to the early modern theater. Shakespeare’s theatre,
    especially at the open-air playhouses like the Globe, lacked most means of modern
    day crowd control such as dimmable lighting and assigned seating. Audiences could be
    unruly and loud. Pre-show concerts were common to occupy the time of early arrivers.
    Brass fanfares were used to announce the start of performances because they cut
    through the hubbub in the auditorium, at least temporarily quieting the buzz, and
    focusing the audience’s attention.</p>

    </div>
<p>Without the extensive illusionistic scenery of the modern theatre, music was also
    important to scene setting. Trumpet fanfares like those used in the actual royal
    palaces announced the entrance of noble characters onto the stage, quickly
    establishing the location when no scenic clues were available to do so. Hunting
    horns might signal a shift to an outdoor setting because of their association with
    the aristocracy at their favorite form of play. Instrumental consorts playing
    background music could establish social gatherings like Capulet’s ball or Timon’s
    dinner party. It might even subtly imply scenes are set at night and in the dark,
    when the theatre was, in reality, brilliantly illuminated in the afternoon sun. In a
    theatrical tradition much more focused on hearing than seeing, music could convey
    dramatic information as well as entertain.</p>
<p>References to dance are metaphorically invoked throughout the Shakespeare canon to
    imply harmony and concord, but especially in the comedies, actual dancing is also
    used to symbolize (as it was at court) the reaching of agreement or the resolution
    of discord. Is his study, <em>Shakespeare and the Dance</em>, Alan Brissenden notes,
    “In some plays, <em>Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> and <em>The
        Winter’s Tale</em> among them, dance is essential to the dramatic action…”
    Character is developed and plot is conveyed through onstage dancing. The story
    becomes incomprehensible if it is eliminated.</p>
<h2><strong>The Use of Song and Dance in the Play</strong></h2>
<p>Central to <em>MND</em> are three songs, two of which are also dances. The play also
    contains an additional two freestanding dances. All of these play a significant role
    in the story, including the resolution of the major conflict between Oberon and
    Tytania in the supernatural plot.</p>
<p>Beyond these five major music cues, stage directions or dialogue also contain direct
    reference to incidental music on two occasions and specify a trumpet flourish (a
    kind of fanfare) or the sounding of horns on five more occasions. Performance
    practice of the time would suggest several more instances, like the beginning of the
    play for example, where music was probably used but it is not specified in the stage
    directions of the quartos or the folio.</p>

<p>None of the original music has survived. (It is possible, even probable, that
    pre-existing popular tunes were utilized as settings so there was no “original
    music.”) It is easy, however, to determine the function and tone of all the music
    from the words and stage directions alone. For those with historical interest in
    what an Elizabethan performance might have sounded like several sources have
    suggested possible settings from extant tunes, ballads, or airs of the time with
    similar themes and/or meters. A few of these will be discussed below. </p>
<p>This edition identifies 25 probable music cues, and occasions for four dances. In
    Performance Mode these are marked with this symbol: <span class="performer-text">♫</span>

    open a note that explains briefly the nature and function of the cue. A longer

<h2><strong>The Five Essential Music/Dance Moments</strong></h2>
<p><strong>“You spotted snakes with double tongue”</strong></p>

<h4 class="actor">FAIRY </h4>
<ol><li>Hence, away: Now all is well.</li>

</div>
<p>Of greatest importance are the three songs in the play. The first of these happens in
    Unit 12, when Tytania commands her followers to perform a roundel (a kind of round
    dance) and a song. The song has two stanzas in the form of quatrains and a
    seven-phrase refrain that follows both. A two-line coda ordering all the fairies to
    disperse—except a sentinel to keep watch—was originally printed as part of the
    lyrics and it is sometimes sung, but is now usually treated as dialogue.</p>
<p>The refrain of the song is a lullaby that induces the fairy queen to sleep, but the
    quatrains serve a different purpose. They are incantations against the invasion of
    serpents and spiders. The function of the accompanying dance in a circle around
    Tytania is the weaving of a spell that creates a protective perimeter around her. </p>
<p>The structure and tone of the song suggests that it is an art song rather than a folk
    song, which in turn implies that it was accompanied by an instrumental ensemble. (A
    stage direction specifically calls for such an ensemble at a later point in the
    play, and since it was available it is hard to imagine that it was not used here as
    well.)</p>
<p>The early editions are somewhat confusing about the exact assignments of the singers,
    but most settings of the song assign the two stanzas to soloists and the refrain to
    the ensemble. Nothing suggests that specific named fairies must be assigned to any
    particular lyric, however, so there is great flexibility in how the lullaby might be
    performed. In practice, it is common for all the fairies to sing the entire piece in
    unison. It is also fairly common for the stanzas to be spoken or chanted in the
    manner of an incantation over a musical underscoring with only the refrain
    completely sung.</p>
<p>In his study of Shakespeare’s music, John H. Long sets the lyrics to a lullaby found
    in Anthony Holborne’s 1597 collection <em>Pavans, galliards, and other short
        aeirs.</em> Andrew Charlton adapts an anonymous 16th century piece called
    “Barafostus’ Dream” for the same purpose. (See bibliography for how to find these
    realizations.) At this writing a recorded version from Duffin’s <em>Shakespeare’s
        Songbook, Vol. 1</em> is available at <a

<p><strong>“The Woosel Cock”</strong> (or “The Ousel Cock” in modern spelling)</p>

<div class="example-text">

</div>
<p>In Unit 19, Bottom sings two fragments from what was apparently a popular folksong of
    the period, although the original tune is no longer known. We do not hear the entire
    song because Tytania interrupts his singing. The song is not accompanied and is not
    necessarily intended to be performed well. The comedy of the scene, in fact, comes
    from the contrast between what we hear from the braying of the transformed Bottom
    and what the enchanted Tytania perceives as an “angelic” voice.</p>

</div>
<p>The lyrics in the printed text includes two quatrains, followed by two sentences that
    are usually interpreted as spoken dialogue, but which Long thinks was a refrain. The
    ditty is a just a device for Bottom to calm himself, and the lyrics are not
    particularly important or relevant to the story. (The song is about birds, ending
    with the cuckoo, references to which figure in many Elizabethan jokes and folksongs
    for its similarity to “cuckold.”) The lyrics easily fit tunes from a large number of
    Elizabethan ballads and folksongs, as it is written in a simple meter. It is, in
    fact, an example of the song meter (as opposed to the sonnet form) of
    “eight-and-six.”</p>
<p>You can hear a rather light-hearted recorded version of Duffin’s conjectural setting
    of the song at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V74-SBG89Bg" target="_blank">
        <strong><em>"The Woosel Cock"</em></strong></a>. Another, much more sincere,
    version of a different setting is available at <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHnrhfevjPI" target="_blank">
        <strong><em>"The Woosel Cock"</em></strong></a></p>
<p>Because the lyrics are not important to the plot, modern productions sometimes
    substitute an entirely different piece of music replicating the effect of using of a
    popular tune familiar to the audience rather than using the now-obscure folksong.
    The editor directed a production in which, at the suggestion of the student
    dramaturg, Bottom sang modern-day hipster crooners’ favorite song, “Wonderwall.”</p>
    <p>*******************************************************</p>
<p><strong>Music such as charmeth sleep</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identified in dialogue at Unit 33 (IV.i.b), Line 67</p>
<p>The climactic use of music and dance in <em>Midsummer</em> takes place in Unit 33 at
    line 65, when Tytania commands it, or more likely at line 67, when Oberon repeats
    the order. Tytania (speaking to unseen forces) asks for “music, such as charmeth
    sleep.” Oberon then follows up her royal request with “Sound music. Come, my queen,
    take hands with me/ and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.” His suggestion
    is that they dance in a manner that will “rock” the ground in the same manner that a
    mother would rock a cradle, combining with the music to keep the four lovers (and
    Bottom) in a deep sleep. Oberon and Tytania then dance together, ending their
    enmity, and resolving their quarrel over the changeling boy that has disrupted
    nature.</p>
    <p> Long suggests that there are two separate musical episodes here: First, the
    music that “charmeth sleep” as ordered by Tytania, and once it is completed, a
    separate piece of music to accompany the dance suggested by Oberon. In modern
    production only one piece of music is commonly used, but it sometimes begins when
    Tytania commands it, and then extends when Oberon gets the idea to dance to it as a
    tool of reconciliation.</p>
<p>We know nothing of the original music, but it was certainly supplied by an off-stage
    consort, as it is supposed to be magically induced. It perhaps represents the
    harmonious “music of the spheres” being made audible. The purpose of this music is
    to refresh and restore the lost senses of the mortals after their mentally and
    physically trying night in the woods. We have every reason, then, to think that the
    music might be calm and peaceful. Long proposes John Dowland’s “Sleep, Wayward
    Thoughts” as found in his <em>First Book of Airs</em> (1597) as a good equivalent
    for what might have been played at this point in the original production. Numerous
    recordings of this piece can be easily found, such as at <a

</div><p>The dance which Oberon and Tytania then perform to mark the restoration of their
    relationship was probably a pavane, a stately court dance of the period. A simple
    demonstration of this dance can be found at <a

        <p>*******************************************************</p>
<p><strong>Bergomask</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance identified in dialogue, occurring at Unit 49
    (V.i.m), line 309</p>
<p>In the early modern period, theatrical events involved more than just the formal
    play. They might include pre-show crowd pleasers like fencing bouts or short
    concerts, and almost always ended with some kind of postlude and a dancing
    demonstration. In keeping with theatrical custom, after performing <em>Pyramus and
        Thisbe</em>, Bottom and his crew offer just such an epilogue or a dance. Already
    familiar with their ability to deliver verse, Theseus wisely chooses the latter. </p>
<p>The dance they propose to perform is a Bergomask, a lively dance that originally
    poked fun at the rustic and unsophisticated folk dances of the Bergamo region of
    Italy. It was perceived then something like tap or clog dancing is now received—
    that is, as something less elevated than art dance like ballet, but also as possibly
    more entertaining and popular.</p>
<p>Bottom’s proposal to the Duke is that two company members will perform this dance,
    but even if only two start it off the Bergomask is almost universally performed by
    the whole group of mechanicals in modern production. As opposed to the ethereal
    dancing of the fairies that has preceded, and will follow, this dance, the Bergomask
    is usually a vigorous, earthy dance. It is not always accompanied by anything but
    clapping and stomping along to the insistent rhythm, but if music is desired almost
    any lively folk or popular dance will serve in this location.</p>

<p>John Dover Wilson suggests that this piece serves as an anti-masque to the masque
    that will follow (see next entry), so even though it should serve as a grotesque
    parody, it still might be musically and choreographically related to Oberon’s
    song.</p>
<p>One of Shakespeare’s castmates, Will Kemp (who might well have been the original
    Bottom), was a specialist in post-show jigs, and there is an extant tune called
    “Kemp’s Jig” that gives a sense of what kind of music might be used originally. A
    recording is available at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF3PX3xYVYI"

<h3><strong>“Now until the break of day,”</strong> also known as Oberon’s song</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identified in dialogue as song (and dance) Unit 51,

    <div class="example-text">

<li>Trip away. Make no stay.</li>
<li>Meet me all by break of day.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Oberon begins the scene by calling on his followers to give the house “glimmering
    light.” Most modern productions accomplish this by having the fairies enter carrying
    flickering candles, but since in Elizabethan times the carole was a dance performed
    with linked hands, he is more probably (supernaturally) causing or inviting
    twinkling starlight inside the chamber. With modern lighting technology, some
    productions now use small LED lights sewn into the costumes or mounted on
    headdresses to provide this effect and free the actors’ hands.</p>
<p>The form of this masque is six lines of (probably spoken) instruction from Oberon,
    followed by a quatrain extending these instructions by Tytania. At that point, the
    Folio text has a heading that says simply, “The Song.” It is followed by eleven
    couplets which are not specifically assigned to any singer, although the quartos
    omit the heading and assign all of them to Oberon. (Samuel Johnson thought that this
    heading indicated that a (lost) song was inserted here, and that the couplets were a
    spoken section to follow it. The New Oxford Shakespeare seems to accept this
    interpretation. While it is common for song locations to be indicated in this way in
    the Folio, without printing their words, the fact that the couplets were set in
    italic type strongly suggest that Dr. Johnson was mistaken, and that they are lyrics.)</p>
<p>Modern settings utilize a wide variety of assignments of singers to these lyrics.
    While Oberon sometimes sings or intones the whole song, just as often he shares it
    with Tytania and/or with the full ensemble. The couplet “To the best bride-bed will
    we / Which by us will blessed be” seems to indicate plural singers, so it is more than
    defensible to think that all or part of the song should be harmonized (as were most
    caroles) by all the participants.</p>
<p>Ancient caroles, which had something of a processional quality, were generally not
    accompanied but the use of an instrumental consort elsewhere in the play makes it
    plausible that one was also used here.</p>
<p>Andrew Charlton adapts the anonymous 16th century piece, “I Loathe that I Did Love”
    as a setting that gives some sense of what the original might have sounded like.
    (Long prints “The Urchin’s Dance,” written by Edmund Pierce for Thomas Middleton’s
        <em>Blurt, Master Constable</em> as a suggestive analogy, but the tune does not
    fit the meter or form of Oberon’s song, so it serves only to give a feeling of tone
    and style.) Few modern settings attempt to use an Elizabethan style, but most have a
    reverent and harmonious style that provide a fitting conclusion to the play.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Music</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Flourishes and Fanfares</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the essential music cues above, the play calls for short fanfares or
    flourishes, lasting up to ten seconds, to start scenes where Theseus is entering in
    his official role and twice to announce sections of the play-within-the-play,
        <em>Pyramus and Thisbe</em>. Theatrical practice might suggest use of these on
    some other occasions, as well. In the comprehensive list of musical cues (below)
    there are notations about both specified and implied use of trumpets and horns in
    the play. All of these are also notated in Performance Mode. These are among the 25
    cues mentioned at the start of this essay.</p>
<p>Of particular note, however, is the instance of “Sound horns” after Unit 34, line
    120. Because supernatural music has been used to lull the lovers and Bottom into a
    deep sleep, this use of mortal music to wake them and return them to their full
    sensibilities serves as a kind of book-end. Some effort might be expended to relate
    this flourish to the music that “charmeth sleep” in some manner.</p>
<p><strong>Optional incidental music</strong></p>
<p>Because <em>Midsummer</em> is such a musical play, it often involves commissioning a
    complete musical score. For a production utilizing such a score, it is sometimes
    useful to request a few minor pieces of music beyond those specifically called for
    by the text.</p>
<p>In addition to the music noted above, it is common for the mechanicals to have an
    identifying theme that is played at the beginning of their scenes to set the comic
    tone, and the fairies often have their own identifying theme, as well. Notes for
    optional occasions where such music might be used appear in the list of cues below,
    and in Performance Mode.</p>
<p>Bottom calls for music performed on the “tongs and the bones” in Unit 32. These are
    instruments something like the triangle and castanets. Tytania has a line right
    after which seems like a distraction, and the quartos have no musical cue here, but
    the Folio specifies that these instruments actually play. This is an optional
    occasion for a short, perhaps interrupted, piece of music.</p>
<p>Finally, the transition between Units 33 and 34 may require a short musical interlude
    of some sort if Oberon/Theseus and Tytania/Hippolyta are doubling to cover their
    costume change and re-entrance.</p>
<p><strong>One possible incidental dance</strong></p>
<p>In the middle of Unit 18, after Bottom is transformed into an ass, there is an often
    overlooked possible dance cue. As his friends scatter in amazement, Puck enters
    (invisible to them) and says, “I’ll lead you about a round.” Although he may be speaking
    metaphorically, the literal meaning of this line is that he will lead, or “call,” a
    round dance. (In America, these are idiomatically called “square” dances.) One comic
    way of handling this scene is to turn it into a supernaturally compelled dance, and
    it may need both incidental music and choreography.</p>

<h2><strong>Lyrical passages</strong></h2>
<p>Many verse passages in the play are extremely lyrical in nature. Although there is no
    indication that these were intended as songs, several of these “purple” passages
    have been set to music often, especially incantations and speeches that are cast in
    iambic tetrameter, sometimes called “magic meter.” The following list gives a sense
    of speeches from the play for which it is easy to find musical settings: </p>
<p>“Love looks not with the eyes” (Unit 5)</p>
<p>“Over hill, over dale” (Unit 7) Gooch and Thatcher list 43 settings</p>
<p>“I know a bank where the wild thyme blows” (Unit 11, line 252) – Gooch and Thatcher
    list 38 settings</p>
<p>“Up and Down.” (Unit 18, line 45)</p>
<p>“Flower of this purple dye” (Unit 23)</p>
<p>“Be as thou are want to be” (Unit 33, line 52)</p>
<p>“Now the hungry lion roars” (Unit 50)</p>
<p>“If we shadows have offended” (Epilogue)</p>
<h2><strong>Annotated Musical Resources</strong></h2>
<p>Charlton, Andrew. <em>Music in the Plays of Shakespeare: A Practicum.</em> Garland,
    1991.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Charlton’s book is now out of print, but it is well
    worth tracking down for its thorough cue sheets and printed music for suggested
    settings for all the major pieces. The discussion of tone and purpose of each piece
    is very helpful for pre-planning any production whether or not there is any interest
    in historically accurate recreations.)</p>
<p>Duffin, Ross W. <em>Shakespeare's Songbook.</em> Vol. 1, W W Norton, 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The most recent work providing a discussion of the
    music along with printed possible settings for Shakespeare’s songs, this excellent
    volume is easily available. It has a companion CD carried by Naxos of America, which
    makes it possible to hear recordings of many of the most important musical pieces.
    The recorded music has been made available separately by the publisher on many
    streaming music services, so one can easily listen to most of the examples. The
    greatest virtue of this book is that it discusses many pieces of incidental music in
    addition to the major songs and offers suggestions from the period repertoire that
    might satisfy them. The glaring weakness, at least as concerns <em>Midsummer</em>,
    is that it inexplicably omits any discussion of the final song, “Now Until the Break
    of Day.”)</p>
<p>Gooch, Bryan Niel Shirley, et al. <em>A Shakespeare Music Catalogue.</em> Vol. 2,
    Clarendon Press, 1991.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This academic catalogue does not provide any music but is simply an exhaustive list
    of known settings. For <em>Midsummer</em> that totals in the thousands. The
    discussion of <em>Midsummer</em> is illuminating as it covers incidental music for
    the theater, settings for songs intended for concert performance, related pieces
    like Britten’s opera, and settings of verse not originally intended as song.
    Although it has not been updated since 1991, it is still exceptionally helpful.)</p>
<p>Long, John H. <em>Shakespeare's Use of Music.</em> Da Capo Press, 1977.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Now available in an inexpensive reprint by Forgotten Books, Long’s discussion of
    music is sometimes marred by outdated editorial assumptions, but his musical
    selections are useful and his observations about the uses of the music can be very
    astute. He offers very different suggestions of Elizabethan pieces that might work
    from Duffin or Charlton, so this is a good additional resource.)</p>
<p>Place, Gerald, and Rebecca Hickey, singers. Dorothy Linell, Lute. <em>Music for
        Shakespeare's Theatre.</em> Naxos 8.570708, 2008. Musical Recording.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This recording of period music for Shakespeare’s plays, also made widely available
    by the publisher on streaming services, includes “The Woosel Cock” and “You Spotted
    Snakes,” along with a short version of “Kemp’s Jig.”)</p>
