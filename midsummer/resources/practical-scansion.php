<h1>Practical Scansion</h1>
<p>Scansion—the beating out of the rhythm of Shakespeare's verse—is a fundamental skill for
    the performer. To the degree that it has a practical application in spoken delivery of
    the lines it is relatively simple to learn to do. <em>Midsummer </em>is a nearly ideal
    play in which to first practice the skill because it is extremely regular, but offers at
    least a few examples of all the kinds of complications that actors regularly
    encounter.</p>
<p>Crucial to speaking and performing Shakespeare's verse is the ability to scan the lines
    and understand their inherent rhythm. "Performer Mode" does not attempt to fully scan
    and mark every line (using the familiar x / x / x / x / x / notation, or any other
    system) but it does seek to assist beginners with identifying the main scansion issues
    in the play and give even experienced professionals a way to double check troublesome
    lines. </p>
<p>"Performer Mode" provides the overview needed for delivery of the lines while
    sight-reading or rehearsing. The aim is to make as transparent as possible to moments of
    decision and the options available to the actor.</p>
<h2> Verse and Prose </h2>
<p> First, although the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries are often written with
    high proportions of verse, they are rarely completely written in poetic forms. <em> A
        Midsummer Night's Dream </em> is about 80% verse. A quick look at Unit 6, a prose
    scene, compared to the five units that precede it, will suffice to make the difference
    clear. Prose lacks the regularity of line length and metricality of verse. Where verse
    begins each line with a capital letter (whether or not it is the beginning of a
    sentence) and stops short of the right margin, prose runs completely to the margin and
    does not "start over" until the beginning of a new paragraph. </p>
<p> In the case of prose, there is no intended rhythmic pattern, hence there is nothing to
    scan. </p>
<h2>Regular Verse Lines</h2>
<p>Even in verse scenes, the vast majority of lines in the play are unmarked in the
    performer mode, because they need no intervention by the actors. That is to say, the
    verse in <em>Midsummer</em> is surprisingly regular. With the exception of a single
    speech that is fully annotated in the text, Shakespeare uses only three basic meters in
    this play, (pentameter, tetrameter and—for the purpose of parody in <em>Pyramus and
        Thisbe</em>—"fourteeners") all with an iambic pulse. For the most part, simply
    speaking the words as written will yield the desired effect. Anyone who has learned that
    Shakespeare's lines go "de-<strong>DUM</strong> | de-<strong>DUM</strong> |
        de-<strong>DUM</strong> | de-<strong>DUM</strong> | de-<strong>DUM</strong>|" will
    find ample confirmation because a large number of lines in <em>Midsummer</em> do so and
    one must be stubbornly perverse and unmusical about delivery to prevent this
    straightforward effect. Below are examples, with their feet marked by vertical strokes,
    for clarity:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <ol>
        <li>This <strong>man</strong> | hath <strong>my</strong> | con<strong>sent</strong>
            | to <strong>mar</strong>|ry <strong>her.</strong> | (Unit 2, line 26)</li>
        <li>To <strong>you</strong> | your <strong>fath</strong>|er <strong>should</strong>
            | be <strong>as</strong> | a <strong>god.</strong> | (Unit 2, line 48)</li>
        <li>I <strong>do</strong> | en<strong>treat</strong> | your <strong>grace</strong> |
            to <strong>par</strong>|don <strong>me.</strong> | (Unit 2, line 60)</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>These lines are examples of strict iambic pentameter, and because they can be read right
    off the page without complication "Performer Mode" does not comment on them.</p>
<p>Special note: On rare occasions, about 35 times in this play, a single line of verse can
    be shared by two or more speakers. You can tell that this is the case because the verse
    is arranged on the page with the words of the second speaker indented beyond that of the
    first. Here is such an arrangement:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <h4 class="actor">THESEUS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Call Philostrate.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="actor">PHILOSTRATE</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="half-line">Here, mighty Theseus.</span> (Unit 39, line 39)</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>Because the line is regular, "Performer Mode" does not annotate it, but the second
    speaker needs to be sure not to "break the verse," i.e. don't leave a pause, before
    speaking.</p>
<h2>Verse Lines with Variations </h2>
<p>The problem with the "de-<strong>DUM</strong> | de-<strong>DUM</strong> |
        de-<strong>DUM</strong> | de-<strong>DUM</strong> | de-<strong>DUM</strong>|" rule
    of thumb is that it is a vast oversimplification. Shakespeare doesn't really write in
    strict iambic pentameter, and it is rare to find an extended passage utilizing it. Poets
    of the Elizabethan period generally favored <strong>blank verse</strong>, a form of
    unrhymed iambic pentameter <em>that extensively employs three minor variations</em> to
    provide flexibility and reduce monotony. </p>
<p>These variations are easily observed, and their effect is easy to hear. A wide number of
    different terms are used to identify them, however, which can be confusing to the
    novice. </p>
<p><em>1. Heads (trochaic inversions)</em></p>
<p>The first of these variations is called, simply, a "head" in this volume. Heads occur
    when a trochee is substituted for the first—and only the first—iambic foot of the line.
    (A trochee is the opposite rhythm from an iambus; instead of "de-<strong>DUM</strong>"
    it goes "<strong>DUM</strong>-de.") This effect is also sometimes called the
        <em>inverted opening, strong opening, trochaic variation,</em> or <em>hard
        start</em>. </p>
<p>Here are a few lines that use this variation:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Rath</strong>er | your eyes | must with | his judg|ment look. | (Unit 2,
            line 59)</li>
        <li><strong>Chant</strong>ing | faint hymns | to the | cold, fruit|less moon. |
            (Unit 2, line 75)</li>
        <li><strong>Scorn</strong>ful | Lysan|der, true, | he hath | my love: (Unit 2, line
            97)</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>Like perfectly regular lines, these lines really have no actor decisions to be made in
    them either, because no one says "ra-<strong>THER</strong>, chan-<strong>TING</strong>,
    or scorn–<strong>FUL</strong>." Simply speaking the line naturally, without
        "talk-<strong>KING</strong> bizarrely” will yield Shakespeare's intended rhythm.
    Heads provide a small burst of power, and a bit of rhythmic variety, but they are
    unexceptional within the rules of blank verse as Shakespeare and his contemporaries
    practiced it and do not require a special notation in performer mode.</p>
<p>More rarely, and a little more surprisingly, heads can also occur at the beginning of
        <em>phrase,</em> even if that happens mid-line. That is, they also happen
    immediately after a punctuated break at midline, which is technically termed a
        <em>caesura</em>. (This break is marked in lines in this essay with this double
    vertical stroke: ‖.) When they do so, the pattern is still that only one poetic foot is
    reversed and then the line returns to its normal pattern.</p>
<p>Here is an example of such a line:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <ol>
        <li>De<strong>vout</strong>|ly <strong>dotes</strong>, ‖ <strong>dotes</strong> in |
                i<strong>dol</strong>|a<strong>try</strong>, (Unit 2, line 111)</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>Again, this line is not marked out for special treatment in performer mode, because it is
    quite natural to emphasize both occurrences of "dotes," and would be very odd to choose
    to say "dotes <strong>IN</strong>."</p>
<p>Finally, it is theoretically possible for a line to have a head at both the beginning and
    at the midline <em>caesura</em> and still be considered "regular variations," and some
    of Shakespeare's later plays contain such lines, but none occur in
    <em>Midsummer</em>.</p>
<h2><em>2. Headless Lines (Catalexes)</em></h2>
<p>In <em>Midsummer</em>, Shakespeare frequently uses a second variation of line or phrase
    beginnings in which the first foot consists only of a single stressed syllable. Scholars
    think of these as iambic feet with a silent first syllable, like a musical rest. These
    empty syllables are technically known as “catalexes;” the singular is “catalexis.”
    (Warning about terminological confusion: In classical Greek and Roman poetry, these
    unexpectedly empty syllables often sit at the end–rather than the beginning–of the line,
    and some scholars use the term exclusively for such cases, but when scanning Shakespeare
    the term is almost always used for headless lines.)</p>
<p>The empty syllable is marked in this essay and in "Performer Mode" with this convention:
    (X). You will sometimes see these empty feet marked with a carat <strong>^</strong> in
    traditional scanning systems, but that is not the convention used in this edition
    because the symbol is not visible enough for sight-reading.</p>
<p>This variation is very rare when the meter is iambic pentameter, although
        <em>Midsummer</em> does contain one example, made a little trickier because it also
    has a head after the <em>caesura</em>. </p>
<div class="example-text">
    <ol>
        <li>(X) <strong>Melt</strong>|ed <strong>as</strong> | the <strong>snow</strong>, ‖
                <strong>seems</strong> to | me <strong>now</strong> (Unit 34, line 149)</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>That said, an extremely common meter for supernatural characters in this play is iambic
    tetrameter (a line of four, rather than five, iambic feet) and <em>more</em> of these
    lines are headless than are completely regular. There are dozens of instances in the
    play.</p>
<p>Here are two examples:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <ol>
        <li>(X) I | do wan|der ev|’rywhere | (Unit 7, line 4)</li>
        <li>(X) Do | it for | thy true | love take. | (Unit 13, line 27)</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>And an entire speech (Unit 51, lines 322-327) in iambic tetrameter in which all lines are
    headless:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <ol>
        <li>(X) <strong>Through</strong> | the <strong>house</strong> | give
                <strong>glimm</strong> |’ring <strong>light</strong>, | </li>
        <li>(X) <strong>By</strong> | the <strong>dead</strong> | and <strong>drow</strong>
            |sy <strong>fire</strong>. |</li>
        <li>(X) <strong>Ev</strong> |ery <strong>elf</strong> | and <strong>fair</strong>|y
                <strong>sprite</strong> | </li>
        <li>(X) <strong>Hop</strong> | as <strong>light</strong> |as <strong>bird</strong> |
            from <strong>briar</strong>, |</li>
        <li>(X) <strong>And</strong> | this <strong>dit</strong>|ty <strong>af</strong>|ter
                <strong>me</strong>, |</li>
        <li>(X) <strong>Sing</strong> | and <strong>dance</strong> | it<strong>
                trip</strong>|ping<strong>ly</strong>. | (Unit 51, lines 322-27)</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>Again, there is nothing specifically to do, except perhaps leave a tiny pause (often
    filled with a gesture or a step) where the empty syllable is, so that the underlying
    musical beat remains recognizable.</p>
<p><em>3. Tails (Feminine Endings)</em></p>
<p>The last of these common variations is the use of an extra, unstressed syllable at the
    end of the line. This variation is technically known as a "feminine" ending, a name
    borrowed from French <em>poésie</em> because it tends to be produced by use of
    grammatically feminine nouns (which, in French, often end with an extra unaccented
    syllable compared to their masculine forms) at the ends of lines. </p>
<p>In English, where nouns are not gendered, this terminology has been contested for some
    time because it sounds sexist instead of grammatical. Many people now call it a
        <em>weak</em>, <em>double</em> or <em>soft</em> ending instead. Because this
    variation happens at the end of a line, it is also sometimes known as a <em>line end
        variation</em>. This edition of the play calls it, simply, a "tail." It is marked in
    scanned lines below by preceding the syllable with a left parenthesis: (</p>
<p>Here are a few examples from the play:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <ol>
        <li>The <strong>rest</strong> | I'd <strong>give</strong> | to <strong>be</strong> |
            to <strong>you</strong> | trans<strong>la</strong> (ted. | (unit 4, line 194)</li>
        <li>Since <strong>once</strong> | I <strong>sat</strong> | up<strong>on</strong> | a
                <strong>prom</strong>|on<strong>tor</strong> (y, | (Unit 9, line 149)</li>
        <li>Tempt <strong>not</strong> | too <strong>much </strong>| the
                <strong>hat</strong>|red <strong>of</strong> |my <strong>spi</strong>r(it,
            | (Unit 10, line 213)</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>In all these cases, the effect is palpable, but there is no real decision to be made. The
    line sounds perfectly normal through ten syllables, and then–surprise!–it is not quite
    finished. One more, gentle syllable follows. What actor would simply leave the syllable
    off, however? These effects are built into the lines and need no special marking in
    performance mode. These are still cases where the actor simply says the line.</p>
<h2><em>The thing that even experts miss about tails…</em></h2>
<p>There is an important point about tails that needs special attention. Like heads, they
    apply to both lines <em>and phrases</em>. That is, a phrase that ends at mid-line (i.e.
    just before a <em>caesura</em>) can also have a tail, although this is uncommon,
    especially in early plays. In a technical sense, this is not controversial, but even
    many experts tend to forget this rule and get very confused when this phenomenon (called
    an <em>epic caesura</em>) occurs. </p>
<p>These are eleven syllable lines–exactly like a line with an ordinary tail–but the extra
    syllable is not where it is expected rhythmically. There are a number of these in
        <em>Midsummer,</em> and even though no decision needs to be made by the actor, these
    lines cause so much confusion that most are annotated in this edition. In the attached
    note, the line is fully scanned to help explain what is going on and reassure the actor
    that despite the odd feel, the line is still regular within the “rules” as Shakespeare
    understood them.</p>
<p>Further, a line can have a tail at <em>both</em> the <em>caesura</em> and the line end,
    so it can have twelve syllables and still be technically regular with variations. These
    are <em>very</em> rare, but there are examples in <em>Midsummer</em>, and they are
    notated and fully scanned in student mode. There is still no decision to be made by the
    actor, but to avoid confusion these are identified.</p>
<p>Here is an example of such a line:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <ol>
        <li>Un<strong>coup</strong> |le <strong>in</strong> | the <strong>west</strong>|ern
                <strong>vall</strong> (ey, ‖ let <strong>them</strong> (go: | (Unit 34, line
            89)</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>Try saying it once without the tails, and you can hear that it is a regular line that
    just happens to have two tail variations.</p>
<p>In <strong>all</strong> these cases, there is really nothing for the actor to do except
    to say the line as written. As Shakespeare and his contemporaries practiced the art of
    writing blank verse these variations were thought of as adding variety, but not as
    making the lines irregular. Because of this, most lines with variations are not marked
    in this edition, although mid-line tails are sometimes notated because they can confuse
    even experienced readers and performers. The issue is learning to recognize these
    “regular lines with variations,” rather than doing anything about them.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that multiple variations can occur in a single line. Here is
    an example of a double tail with a head:</p>
<div class="example-text">
    <ol>
        <li><strong>That</strong> is |the <strong>mad</strong> (man. ‖ The
                <strong>lov</strong>|er, <strong>all</strong> |as <strong>fran</strong>(tic, |
            (Unit 38, line 10)</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<h2>The Elasticity of English: Lines that Require Attention by Actors</h2>
<p>The previous sections were about seeing how Shakespeare understood “regular” lines in a
    more complex way than we have generally been taught. While it is certainly important to
    develop this more nuanced perspective, it is not the main issue.</p>
<p>For anyone speaking Shakespeare’s lines aloud, scansion is primarily about understanding
    and applying the <em><strong>elasticity</strong></em> of the spoken English language.
    (Or put another way, spoken English is more versatile than its written counterpart. Too
    much analysis of Shakespeare’s lines treats the written lines with a rigidity that is
    neither appropriate, nor historically accurate.)</p>
<p>For performers and students speaking aloud the greatest challenge to scanning the verse
    is the surprisingly large number of lines that don’t appear at first glance to be
    regular, but which probably are. The reason being that many lines contain
        <em>elastic</em> words, that is, words or word combinations that can vary in their
    length depending on context. For example, the word <em>interest</em> is commonly thought
    to be a three-syllable word, <strong>in-ter-est</strong>, and so it is usually divided
    in a dictionary. In everyday usage, however, it is typically pronounced
        <strong>in-trest</strong>: two syllables. In the drama of the early modern period
    both pronunciations are used interchangeably, depending on the needs of the meter. </p>
<p>There are hundreds of such cases where the printed form of the word does not immediately
    convey the manner in which the word fits into the metrical pattern. In addition, there
        are<em> word combinations</em> that are likewise elastic, for example, “to add” or
    “the edge,” where side-by-side vowels often combine into a single sound: t’add, or
    th’edge.</p>
<p>In both kinds of these cases, the dictionary syllable count can be quite misleading. We
    don’t actually speak in the same way as we write, with ev-er-y / word / ful-ly /
    pro-nounc’d / and / sep-a-rat-èd, so as to keep entirely distinct from its neighbors. We
    frequently blur syllables–and even whole phrases–together in ways that are often labeled
    "mumbling" but are useful real-life tricks for compressing data and speeding
    communication. (This compression is the reason that it is so hard to understand native
    speakers of a foreign language you are studying, and why they have so much trouble
    understanding you.) “I have got to…” becomes “I gotta.” “Could have” comes out sounding
    like “could of” or even just “couda.” An entire range of vowel sounds, when moved to an
    unstressed position, simplify into the all-purpose schwa [ə], and are sometimes just
    left out altogether.</p>
<p>Spoken English is full of elisions and contractions that are so common as to go largely
    unnoticed, and which are now often explicitly purged from formal writing. </p>
<p>Our reverence for Shakespeare’s linguistic brilliance sometimes makes us think that he
    didn’t speak like a normal person, and he didn’t understand how normal people speak.
    Neither belief is true. The earliest printed versions of Shakespeare’s plays often
    contained indications of his keen ear. Where “Ile” was often printed in the early modern
    period, editors later modernized it to “I’ll.” Recently, a tendency to formalize his
    spelling (and to prioritize readers over users) has resulted in “I will.” Similarly, “Ore” became
    “o’er” and now is sometimes printed “over” without regard for the resulting addition of
    a syllable.</p>
<p>In many other cases, the first printing didn’t necessarily record the shortening, but it
    is clear, nonetheless. Modern editions are extremely reluctant to print “sprite” where
    the quartos and folios say “spirit,” even when it provides a rhyme for “quite.” But why?
    Too much reverence works against good verse speaking.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meter is the central issue for verse speakers, the main use of
    notation in "Performer Mode" is clarifying the scansion. Whenever possible, typographical
    conventions are adopted to show where the actor must take action. Elisions (the internal
    elimination of a syllable from a word) and contractions (the loss of a syllable by
    combining words) are indicated by apostrophes. Eighteenth century editors routinely
    employed this device, but the contemporary tendency is to eliminate such conventions.
    This, admittedly, makes the printed page cleaner and easier to read, but if often
    obscures the clues to the metrics that were once available. (In this edition, if ease of
    reading is your immediate concern, you can always just click into any other mode to see
    the unaltered text. Only "Performer Mode" is orthographically organized around scansion
    issues.) </p>
<p>Another frequently used convention is the adoption of the superscripted “gamma” [
        <strong>ᵞ </strong>] to indicate a blurring of a commonly independent syllable
    spelled with an “i” into the next syllable, like the ends of the words “Indian” and
    “Athenian” when those are pronounced “yan.”</p>
<p>The verse in <em>Midsummer</em> is so regular that if you understand variations and
    elasticity, there are less than a dozen instances of irregular lines. If fact, the
    quality of the verse is so dependable that deviations are used to diagnose corruption in
    the transmission of the text. Because copyists, typesetters, and proofreaders can make
    mistakes, words were sometimes left out of lines. Handwriting was sometimes misread so
    the wrong word was inserted into the text. Other minor issues occasionally marred the
    accurate passing down of the text.</p>
<p>It has often been said that irregularity should be treated as an acting note, which is a
    useful attitude, but not until after it has been thoroughly investigated as a textual
    problem. The manner in which modern editorial and performance practice most diverge is
    the degree to which contemporary editors seeks to preserve the bibliographic history of
    the text even if it means printing obviously flawed lines, while dramaturgs/directors
    tend more often to prefer emendation (even if the text cannot be definitively shown to be
    corrupted) if it results in a regular line that is easier to speak and understand. This
    edition favors the latter approach, with appropriate annotation.</p>
<h2> Other Types of Shortenings </h2>
<p> Occasionally, words in Shakespeare's plays scan with fewer syllables than we might
    expect. In many cases this is because we actually speak English much more informally
    than we write it. For example, in everyday conversation, only people with pedantically
    exact diction say "be-ing" as a two-syllable word. Almost everyone shortens it to
    "bing." It is never written in the shorter form, however. Our eyes can fool us, but
    Shakespeare had an excellent ear and often constructed lines according to how they
    actually sound, not how they look. </p>
<p> A few words were pronounced differently in Elizabethan times, usually because of the
    elimination of an internal syllable consisting of a single vowel sound: "innocent" was
    commonly pronounced "inn'cent,"" perjury" became "perj'ry," and "venomous" contracted to
    "ven'mous." All such cases in the play are noted in "Performer Mode," and clicking on
    the word will bring up a full explanation with a pronunciation guide. Contemporary
    performance practice almost universally observes these cases because these words are
    still easily intelligible without the missing syllable. </p>
<h2> Specific Cases </h2>
<p>
    <em> The "The+vowel" and "To+vowel" Rules </em>
</p>
<p> In normal speech, when the words "the" and "to" are followed by words that begin with a
    vowel sound the two words are combined in a way that leaves only one vowel sound. Notice
    how everyone actually says "t'arrange" not "to/arrange." You usually hear "th'ending"
    not "thee/ending." Shakespeare honored our actual speech patterns. He wrote verse that
    accounts for the changes we normally introduce. These scansion instances are easily
    addressed, since it is what we normally do. They merely require us to avoid the kind of
    over-enunciation that we sometimes assume that Shakespeare needs – but doesn't! </p>
<p>
    <em> The Missing V Rule </em>
</p>
<p> A much more complex consideration arises from the extensive elimination of particular
    consonants in the middle of words (medial <em> V</em>s, but occasionally also medial
        <em> TH</em>s and <em> K</em>s) in Shakespeare's era. We are used to seeing this as
    a poetic convention when applied to the words "over" (o'er) and "ever" (e'er), but most
    people are very surprised how widely it applies to other words like: devil, heaven,
    evil, given, having, whether, hither, other, and taken. All these cases reduce the word
    length by a full syllable, which we do not expect because there is no modern equivalent.
    The difficulty is doubled because, for easy legibility, these contractions are almost
    never marked in modern printed texts. </p>
<p> All such instances <em> are </em> marked in this text's "Performer" mode, with an
    attached note referring to them as instances of the "Missing V Rule." In every case, a
    decision must be made about how to treat it, since audiences are not used to hearing
    these words without their middle consonants and often cannot understand the word without
    them. The notes explain how the specific cases are treated in modern performance
    practice—as there are a variety of strategies about how to preserve both the scansion
    and the intelligibility. </p>
<p>
    <em> The Variable Name Rule </em>
</p>
<p> Names are notoriously variable in Shakespeare, shifting to meet the needs of the meter.
    In some cases, the name can appear in two forms: Helen and Helena, for example. Often,
    however, a name can be pronounced more than one way: Rome-ee-oh, or Rome-yo. Jule-ee-et,
    or Jule-yet. Neither form is more "correct" than the other. It is simply a matter of
    discovering how many syllables a name occupies in a given line and finding the
    pronunciation that fits it. In <em> Midsummer</em>, this is fairly straightforward in
    all cases but that of Demetrius. His name is frequently shortened to Demetr'us, which
    feels a bit awkward at first. All cases where adjustments are necessary are indicated in
    "Performer Mode" with green text and annotated with a full explanation. </p>
<h2> Expansions </h2>
<p>The elasticity highlighted above is primarily about elimination of a syllable under
    specific circumstances, but we also want to consider cases where a syllable is
    added:</p>
<p> In Shakespeare's time a few words were pronounced with one additional syllable—usually
    an expanded ending. For example, the past tense of many words was accented. Today, we
    still have a few words where we occasionally handle these endings in an expanded manner:
    wretchèd, agèd, and blessèd are all sometimes treated as two-syllable words. In
    Shakespeare's time this practice applied to many more words, however: wishèd, renownèd,
    and crazèd all appear in <em> Midsummer</em>, for example. </p>
<p> Words that end in "ion" were also usually expanded: imaginatïon (im-aj-in-a-see-un) and
    confusïon (con-few-see-un) are so treated in this play. </p>
<p> A fairly substantial number of words in English are still spelled in a way that
    indicates their former expansions, although we have long since abandoned the extra
    syllable when two vowel sounds sit side by side: patïence, marriäge, vengëance, and
    oceän, for example. </p>
<p> In a very small number of cases, possessives also expanded. In <em> Midsummer </em>
    there is an instance where "moon's" takes the archaic two-syllable form "moonës." </p>
<p> In this edition, anywhere that an expansion is required to maintain the intended meter
    the word appears in green text while in "Performer Mode," and with the expanded syllable
    marked just as in the examples in this section. Clicking directly on the word will
    access an explanatory note. </p>
<p> That Shakespeare spoke some words with an additional syllable, and wrote these rhythms
    into his verse, does not <em> automatically </em> mean that a modern actor must do so,
    however. Contemporary performance practice generally considers intelligibility primary,
    expanding words that can still be easily understood, but not always observing
    alterations that make words too difficult to understand or drawing too much alienating
    attention. Scansion notes tell us about the meter of the line, but deciding what to do
    about such metrical considerations is an aesthetic decision to be made in context.
    Expanding "ion" endings, especially at the end of lines, was (until recently) frequently
    avoided. A renewed interest in "Original Pronunciation" is changing that, but adoption
    is uneven. Expanded past tenses are easily understood, however, so usually spoken. </p>
<p> Especially when an archaic or formal sound might be helpful, for characters from the
    ancient world, for magical incantations, or to portray stuffy priggishness, it is also
    common to use the archaic pronunciation despite its odd sound. </p>
<h2> Accentuation Changes </h2>
<p> Pronunciation of a few words has shifted since Shakespeare's time to accent different
    syllables than now receive emphasis, and confusingly sometimes the same word is
    pronounced two different ways inside a single play. This happens because the word was
    undergoing change in his era, as a few words are still unsettled in ours: both <strong>
        ád</strong>ver<strong>tíse</strong>ment and ad<strong>vért</strong>isement are
    acceptable, for example. Is it ba<strong>nál</strong>, or <strong> bá</strong>nal? In
    Shakespeare's time this applied especially to words that began with "con" or "com":
    confessor, consort, compact, and complete sometimes have first syllable accents. A
    couple of others that appear in <em> Midsummer </em> are per<strong>sév</strong>ere and
        re<strong>vén</strong>ue. All these cases are marked in the notes in "Performer"
    mode, with complete explanations and guides to pronunciation, although—like expansions—the 
    performer must still decide how to handle the possible confusion. </p>
<h2> Alternative Verse Patterns </h2>
<p> It is so common to say that Shakespeare's plays are written in blank verse, that there
    is a general tendency to overlook the deliberate use of some alternatives in <em> A
        Midsummer Night's Dream</em>. Although the play is extensively written in blank
    (that is, unrhymed) verse, it has a very high proportion of couplets that
        <strong>do</strong> rhyme. These lines present no particular difficulty beyond an
    occasional decision about how to treat pairs of words whose pronunciation has changed
    over time so that they no longer rhyme: move/love, eyes/qualities. Modern practice is
    usually to use contemporary pronunciations and avoid the historic rhyme. The exception
    is when a comic or antique effect is desirable. </p>
<p> Of far greater importance: The fairies often speak in iambic tetrameter (four iambic
    feet per line) rather than pentameter. The principles of scansion do not change, except
    that the expectation is a line of eight syllables—with variations—instead of ten. The
    spoken effect can be very different, however. Tetrameter can sound deliberately odd.
    Many productions of <em> Midsummer </em> heighten this effect by preserving all archaic
    pronunciations, including historic rhymes, in the performance of the fairies to
    emphasize their other-worldliness. </p>
<p> Finally, the "Mechanicals" perform a playlet in Act V, which consists of highly
    alliterative verse reminiscent of medieval theatre—but of such (intentionally) poor
    quality that it is doggerel. Theoretically, scansion patterns still apply to it but
    given the parody inherent in the scene, there is little point to obsessing over it.
    Historic rhymes in the verse, such as good/blood, are often exaggerated to increase the
    comedy. </p>
<p>One last note: Occasionally Shakespeare breaks up a long passage of verse by inserting a
    short, blunt prose line (often about four syllables long) right in the middle of a verse
    dialogue. These are often practical lines, like "Let him come in." These offer
    interesting rhythmic variety but do not, and are not meant to, scan. They are always
    isolated, however, and the blank verse pattern returns with the very next line.</p>
<h2> Summary </h2>
<p> In a technical sense, (if one choses to observe every instance of historic
    pronunciation) virtually every line in <em> A Midsummer Night's Dream </em> is
    "regular." The uniformity of the verse is quite pronounced. Only two cases of the epic
    feminine caesura occur in the entire play, and it has far fewer variations that later
    plays. The very few exceptions, about which there is some scholarly disagreement, are
    clearly annotated and explained in this edition. </p>
<p> It takes a little bit of practice to learn to identify the instances where the performer
    must make some small accommodation in order to achieve the regularity that Shakespeare
    gave the text, but it is much less complicated than learning the technical names for all
    types of variation and identifying all instances of rhythmic deviation. It is simply a
    matter of learning how to maintain the intended rhythms. </p>
<p> Of course, for various reasons, contemporary performance practice sometimes substitutes
    modern pronunciations for archaic ones, but it is best to make such choices after full
    consideration of the options. In "Performer" mode, scansion notes exist to assist the
    process of identification and decision-making. </p>
<h2>Speaking the Verse</h2>
<p>Scanning the verse, of course, is simply preparation for speaking it. It is an attempt to
    understand where the accentuation falls, and how the rhythm of the line works. Once you
    do understand it, there are just a few rules-of-thumb that can help you deliver the
    verse confidently and effectively.</p>
<p>The simplest of these is, “Don’t break the verse.” That is, don’t fill it with
    unnecessary pauses. A verse line is normally spoken on one breath and without
    interruption. (A <em>slight</em> pause can be taken at the <em>caesura</em> to mark the
    end of one phrase and the beginning of another, but even then it is kept to a minimum so
    that the energy of the line continues to the end.) </p>
<p>The related principle is, “Build to the end of the line.” In contemporary conversation it
    is common to start an (often half-formed) sentence with great energy, and then trail off
    while thinking about how to complete it. Verse is exactly the opposite. It builds to the
        <em>end</em> of the line. </p>
<p>A slightly more complicated rule is, “When in doubt, tip the rhythm in favor of the
    meter.” While it is true that the iambic rhythm is written into the lines, it is also
    true that a surprising number of words in English are neutral enough that they can be
    either stressed or unstressed depending on the inclinations of the speaker. The
    internet-famous phrase “I never said she stole my money,” for example, can imply seven
    different meanings contingent upon which word receives the primary emphasis. That is
    because all of these words <em>can</em> be stressed, and none of them <em>must</em> be. </p>
<p>Of course, that is an extraordinary case, but most blank verse lines have at least some
    degree of variability in them. This rule suggests that, where some options exists, a
    good verse speaker makes choices in favor of the meter. In particular, except in
    clear-cut cases of “heads,” it is very helpful to avoid placing stress on a word in the
    off-beat position. The most tempting words are pronouns, which rarely carry the stress
    in Shakespeare’s verse compared with modern speech.</p>
<p>Great verse speaking, on the level of a Judi Dench or Ian McKellen, takes a lifetime to
    master, but simple rules can help anyone get started correctly and carry them a
    surprisingly long way. </p>
