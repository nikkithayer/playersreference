        </div>
        <p>Theseus was a classical hero who conquered the Amazons, captured Hippolyta,
            and then married her. It was he who slew the minotaur. He casually mentions
            in the play that he is related to Hercules.</p>

        <p>
            <strong> HIPPOLYTA</strong>, hi- <strong> pol </strong> -i-t<em>uh </em> [hɪ

        <p> 29 lines (22 verse, 7 prose) distributed across 14 speeches, 265 total
            words, or about 2% of the play </p>
        <p> Hippolyta was, in classical mythology, the queen of a band of warrior women
            known as the Amazons. In the first line of the play, her name alone would be
            enough of a hint for Shakespeare's audience to know that the setting is
            ancient Greece, which as the birthplace of philosophy would have
            associations with order and rationality. </p>

        <p>
            <strong> EGEUS</strong>, <em> eh</em>d- <strong> jee </strong> -us [ɛdˈʒi
            ʌs], a nobleman and father to Hermia </p>
        <p> 41 lines (all verse) distributed across 7 speeches, 302 total words, or
            about 3% of the play </p>
        <p> Egeus' name is an immediate clue to his function as the comedy's "blocking
            figure," an older man preventing the love match of two young people. His
            name has associations with fathers in classical antiquity. In fact, in its
            Greek spelling (Aegeus) it is the name of Theseus' father. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
            <strong> HERMIA</strong>, variable: <strong> hurm </strong> -ee- <em> uh
            </em> [ˈhɜrm i ʌ] or <strong> hurm </strong> -y<em>uh </em> [ˈhɜrm yʌ], in
            love with Lysander </p>
        <p> 165 lines (all verse) distributed across 48 speeches, 1332 total words, or
            about 8% of the play </p>
        <p> In keeping with the classical setting, Shakespeare chooses names for his
            four young lovers that come from classical sources but seems to use them to
            create ironic expectations. Hermia could be intended as a feminine form of
            Hermes, the name of the god of speed and trickery, but Shakespeare's
            original audience would be more likely to associate the name with the woman
            who infamously proved to the philosopher, Aristotle, an obsessive
            distraction from his studies. In this play, of course, Hermia is the
            obsession of not one, but two men. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
            <strong> LYSANDER</strong>, ly- <strong> san </strong> -der [laɪˈsæn dər],
            in love with Hermia </p>
        <p> 176 lines (170 verse, 6 prose) distributed across 50 speeches, 1449 total
            words, or about 8% of the play </p>
        <p> Lysander is a diminutive form of Alexander, which as a classical name
            immediately invokes Alexander the Great, probably as humorous overstatement. </p>

            <strong> DEMETRIUS</strong>, variable: d<em>ih </em> - <strong> mee

                mee </strong> -tr <em> uh</em>s [dɪˈmi trəs], Egeus' choice of husband
            for Hermia </p>
        <p> 128 lines (115 verse, 13 prose) distributed across 48 speeches, 1110 total
            words, or about 6% of the play </p>
        <p> Demetrius is a male form of Demeter, the name of the goddess of marriage. As
            applied here, it may imply that he is more interested in the advantageous
            marriage than the actual woman being proposed as his wife. In <em> Titus
                Andronicus</em>, Shakespeare had already used this name for a villainous
            character. Expectations of danger may also be suggested here, although
            exaggerated for comic effect. </p>

            <strong> HELENA</strong>, <strong> hel </strong> - <em> uh </em> -n<em>uh

            Demetrius </p>
        <p> 229 lines (all verse) distributed across 36 speeches, 1852 total words, or
            about 11% of the play </p>
        <p> Like the other three young people, the unloved Helena's name would have
            ironic associations, in her case with Helen of Troy, who was loved by all
            too many. In <em> The Iliad</em>, she was said to be the cause of the Trojan
            War when the Trojan prince, Paris, kidnapped her from her husband, the Greek
            general Menalaus. Her name is sometimes shortened to "Helen" in this play. </p>

    <li><p>
            <strong> PHILOSTRATE</strong>, <strong> fil </strong> -oh-str<em>ey</em>t
            [ˈfɪl oʊˌstreɪt], Master of the Revels at the court of Theseus </p>
        <p> 24 lines (all verse) distributed across 6 speeches, 189 total words, or
            about 1% of the play. (In the Folio, Philostrate's lines are reassigned to
            Egeus.) </p>
        <p> Like the names of Theseus and Hippolyta, Philostrate's name appears in "The
            Knight's Tale" in Chaucer's <em> Canterbury Tales</em>, where Shakespeare
            may have encountered it. This part is an important one in the Quarto text,
            on which this edition is based, but was incorporated into Egeus' part in the
            Folio, leaving Philostrate as a non-speaking extra in that edition. </p>

<h3> In the Fairy World </h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>
            <strong> OBERON</strong>, <strong> oh</strong> -b<em>uh</em> -ron [ˈoʊ
            bəˌrɒn], King of the Fairies </p>
        <p> 225 lines (all verse) distributed across 29 speeches, 1638 total words, or
            about 10% of the play </p>
        <p> This name for the King of the Fairies is drawn from Spenser's <em> Faerie
                Queene</em>, the great allegorical tale of the British Renaissance. </p>

            <strong> TYTANIA</strong>, ty- <strong> tey </strong> -nee- <em> uh </em>
            [taɪˈteɪ ni ə], Queen of the Fairies </p>
        <p> 141 lines (all verse) distributed across 23 speeches, 1106 total words, or
            about 7% of the play </p>
        <p> The name Tytania appears in Ovid, from which Shakespeare undoubtedly drew
            it, as another moniker for Diana, the moon goddess. In Shakespeare's play
            she appears to be a separate personage, but follower of Diana, and a
            powerful supernatural force, if not a goddess herself. There is no authority
            for the common contemporary spelling or pronunciation of this name. </p>

        <p> 206 lines (all verse) distributed across 33 speeches, 1401 total words, or
            about 10% of the play </p>
        <p> The character we most commonly call Puck is named Robin Goodfellow. A puck
            is what, not who, he is. A puck was a kind of common spirit, or goblin, in
            English folklore. </p>

            about 1% of the play </p>
    </li>
    <li> The four named fairies in the play all have names derived from nature, and all
        of which suggest something very small and insubstantial. The first fairy that we
        meet in the play (in Unit 7, with Puck) does not have a specific name. One of
        the named fairies usually doubles this role in contemporary performance. </li>

<ul>
    <li><p>
            <strong> Peter QUINCE</strong>, kwins [kwɪns], a carpenter (Director of <em>
                Pyramus and Thisbe</em>, who reads the prologue) </p>
        <p> 74 lines (38 verse, 36 prose) distributed across 40 speeches, 995 total
            words, or about 5% of the play </p>
        <p> Whereas the names of the characters in the court are drawn from classical
            antiquity, the mechanicals have names that reflect their professions. Quince
            is reminiscent of "quoins," wedges used by carpenters, but also suggests
            sharpness. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
            <strong> Nick BOTTOM</strong>, <strong> bot </strong> - <em> uh</em>m [ˈbɒt
            əm], a weaver (Pyramus) </p>
        <p> 123 lines (76 verse, 47 prose, 8 song lyrics) distributed across 59
            speeches, 2090 total words, or about 12% of the play </p>
        <p> Bottom's name derives from the spindle used to wind yarn, but inevitably
            also brings to mind (given his upcoming transformation) the contemporary
            usage meaning "ass." </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
            <strong> Francis FLUTE</strong>, floot [flut], a bellows-mender (Thisbe) </p>
        <p> 48 lines (34 verse, 9 prose) distributed across 18 speeches, 369 total
            words, or about 3% of the play </p>
        <p> Flute repairs bellows, in which a hole would produce a wheezing or
            whistling. What is suggested is that he is a teenager whose voice has not
            yet broken. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
            <strong> Tom SNOUT</strong>, [snaʊt], a tinker (Wall) </p>
        <p> 19 lines (12 verse, 7 prose) distributed across 9 speeches, 166 total words,
            or about 1% of the play </p>
        <p> Snout is a tinker, and his name might reflect the spouts of the tea kettles
            he makes and repairs, but certainly suggests that he is "nosey." </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
            <strong> SNUG</strong>, sn<em>uh</em>g [snʌg], a joiner (Lion) </p>
        <p> 11 lines (8 verse, 3 prose) distributed across 4 speeches, 121 total words,
            or under 1% of the play </p>
        <p> Snugness is a desirable quality for the joints, as a joiner is a furniture
            maker. In this case it may imply "dull" or "rigid." </p>
