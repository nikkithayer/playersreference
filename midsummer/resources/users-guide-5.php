<h3> SCANSION </h3>
<p> Before the mid-nineteenth century, virtually all Western drama was written primarily
    in poetic verse, meaning that the lines had a fixed length and a rhythmic regularity
    created by patterns of accented and unaccented syllables. </p>
<p> To fully appreciate, and then perform, plays written in verse, modern students and
    performers need to know how to check the metrical rhythm of the line. This process
    is known by the very formal term "scansion." It might be much less intimidating if
    it were widely known by the more contemporary equivalent word, "skimming." It is
    just a quick perusal to be sure of the intended rhythm. </p>
<p> A century ago it was common practice for editors to indicate their understandings of
    the spoken rhythm in the printed text. In the '60s and 70s, as fashion began to
    favor irregular and free verse, this practice fell out of favor in part because so
    many of these editorial choices provoked controversy. (Of course, there is no reason
    to impose rhythmic regularity where none exists, but the modern issue is the
    tendency to fetishize irregularity even when intended regularity is easily
    discernible.) Avoiding the issue may make the editor less of a target for criticism,
    but it leaves the actor/reader with no assistance toward learning a fundamental
    skill. This edition of <em>Midsummer</em>, therefore, assays this task while
    acknowledging that all scansion choices are ultimately debatable. </p>
<p> This may be less of an issue with this early comedy than with many other plays in
    the canon because the verse is <strong>far</strong> more regular than that in later
    plays. The standard employed for the notes in "Performer" mode is, simply, that the
    choices which result in the most regular line are the options utilized. Of course,
    in production, less rigorous conventions might be adopted. Even in those instances,
    however, it is surely better to make informed choices. In the words of the great
    Shakespearean director Peter Hall, "The first task in approaching a speech is to
    make it scan, or find out why it doesn't." (loc. 315). </p>
<p> The good news is that finding this rhythm is <em>much</em> less difficult than it is
    often made out to be. Armed with just a few principles, and after a little practice,
    it can generally be accomplished by glancing over the text, and tapping out the
    rhythm of any tricky lines. The responsibility for giving the lines their metric
    shape, remember, lies with the playwright. For the user, the responsibility is
    simply to understand and preserve what the playwright has done. </p>
<p> Scansion can be very contestable, and there is no sense in which the scan offered in
    this edition (or any other) can be said to be <em> definitive</em>, but "Performer"
    mode attempts to provide identification of all instances of verse that need a
    performer's special attention. Words or phrases requiring a decision or an
    accommodation are indicated with green type. Clicking on the green text will open a
    note explaining the issue and how to make the words scan regularly. Theses also
    generally include an indication of current performance practice.</p>
