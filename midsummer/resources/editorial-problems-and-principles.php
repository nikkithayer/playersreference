<h1> Editorial Problems and Principles </h1>
    <h2>The major editorial principles of this edition:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The editorial aim has shifted from the traditional one that seeks to recover the
            author’s final “literary” draft (which this editor doubts <em>ever</em> existed
            in the usually imagined form) to one that seeks to recover his intentions for
            the work as a performance script.</li>
        <li>The edition was constructed from the collation of early printings, rather than
            emended from a copy-text.</li>
        <li>In a related—but separate—matter, the editor explicitly rejects the
            long-standing identification of Q1 as having been set directly from
            Shakespeare’s holograph “foul papers.”</li>
        <li>Treating the work as a performance script means it is held to be primarily an
                <em>oral</em> text meant to be spoken and performed. The written form is
            understood to be a means to an end, not the end in itself.</li>
        <li>The edition is a modern spelling rendition, using American spellings.</li>
        <li>Punctuation is modernized.</li>
        <li>The script is generally divided into the traditional act and scene divisions
            established in the eighteenth century, but the primary division—which is unique
            to this edition—is into French scenes for rehearsal purposes.</li>
        <li>Stage directions are extensive (and every attempt has been made to make them
            complete) but only rarely in the wording printed in early modern editions, which
            is of uncertain provenance.</li>
        <li>Speech headings are regularized.</li>
        <li>The edition allows for the possibility that some sections of dialogue were intentionally left
            open-ended in terms of speech assignments.</li>
        <li>All lineation, especially when there are metrical implications, has been
            reëvaluated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More complete explanations of these points appear below:</p>
    <h2>Editorial Aim: A Working Script, Not A Reading Text</h2>
    <p>This experimental text is an attempt to create, not just a new edition, but a new
            <em>kind</em> of edition of <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>. It is also, like
        all acts of textual and/or literary criticism, an attempt to understand the work of
        art better, and to help others understand it better. Those things, however, don’t
        mean that all editions have the same goals, or even the same audiences. </p>
    <p>This edition attempts to understand the text as a performance <em>script</em>,
        rather than a literary text, as has been the <em>de facto</em> case for all other
        editions since at least the eighteenth century, and arguably from the earliest
        quarto printings. Some recent editions of <em>MND</em> have been more open to the
        possibility that the text might serve as a memento of a performance or contain some kind
        of—at least partial—performance record. Although moving closer to the aims of this
        edition, these approaches are not the same as looking at the text as (to use an
        imprecise but useful metaphor) a <em>blueprint</em> for a future performance.</p>
    <p>By contrast to existing editions which aim to recover Shakespeare's literary
        manuscript, the explicit aim of this edition is the historical recovery of <em>A
            Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> as a <strong>script</strong>, primarily to serve as
        the basis for new theatrical productions, along with related creative activities,
        like classroom performance approaches.</p>
    <p>Although there is no serious opposition to the idea that Shakespeare’s play was
        initially created as a script, there is no extant manuscript evidence to that effect for <em>A
            Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, 
        or—for that matter)—any Shakespeare play. The original form of that script must be
        inferred from extant historical evidence of non-Shakespeare plays (such as rough
        drafts, scribal copies, backstage “platts” to guide performance, actors' parts in
        the form of cue scripts, approved books to license production, and working
        promptbooks) which has been vastly undervalued; and from clues in the early print
        copies, which likely have been misinterpreted by editors with little or
        no theatrical experience.</p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
    <img src="../../images/Platt.jpg"
        alt="Platt of Seven Deadly Sins" />
    <p>A backstage "platt," or plot, used to indicte the running order of the show.</p>
</div>
    <p>Wanting to recover the performance script, however complicated by missing evidence
        that might be, should not be controversial in that no one denies that there once was
        such a performance script with a material manifestation. </p>
      <p>Such an edition has been heavily theorized, especially by the late Barbara Hodgdon, M.J.
    Kindnie, and others, but no critical edition has undertaken this task.*
      All editions, in a tradition that dates to the <em>First Folio</em> in 1623,
    explicitly refer to their audiences as “readers.” This is not just convention. Both the
    text and apparatus of previous critical editions are designed for literary study (even
    those versions that have been called “performance editions”) rather than as a basis for
    new production.†</p>
    <p>This is not to suggest that there is anything illegitimate with the aim of these
        existing literary editions. This edition, in fact, builds on this long tradition in
        some significant ways. It is to say, however, that it is regrettable that, at
        present, all critical editions are designed to serve readers rather than
        practitioners. This is probably what David Scott Kastan was getting at when he wrote
        that "There are good reasons… for many kinds of editions, though probably not very
        good reasons for as many of the same kinds of editions as indeed we have…
        Shakespeare should be available in editions that take the theatrical auspices of the
        play seriously, recognizing that primary among Shakespeare’s intentions was the
        desire to write something that could be successfully played.” (p. 123)</p>
    <p>Of course, there are many reasons that all critical editions of Shakespeare have been
        readerly but in the particular case of <em>MND</em> a prominent one is a wide-spread
        assumption that the literary copy was the same as the theatrical copy.‡ Historically
        speaking, this is beyond unlikely, so it is to this matter, after a brief detour,
        that we must next turn.</p>
    <h2>The Question of Copy-Text</h2>
    <p>In a departure from what has become standard editorial procedure in the last seventy
        years this new critical edition of <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream </em>was edited
        without a designated copy-text. Instead, for reasons to be elaborated below, it
        follows the counterproposals of G. Thomas Tanselle, made in his essay, “Editing
        without a Copy-Text.” §</p>
    <p>This edition, therefore—in yet another way it is unlike those currently in print—is,
        as Tanselle suggests it should be, “a constructed text and not an emended one.”
        (Millennium, p. 71)**</p>
    <p><em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> may seem a perverse choice for abandoning
        copy-text editing. It is, after all, a play where the copy-text of choice (Q1) has
        been nearly unanimously adapted since Edward Capell’s edition of 1768, even by the
        often contrarian Wells and Taylor <em>Oxford Shakespeare</em> (1986). While over the
        last fifty years, controversy has engulfed theoretical discussions about exactly
        what aims editors should—and are even able to—serve, <em>A Midsummer Night’s
            Dream</em> has for the most part escaped any involvement in the practical
        implications of this discussion. This is because there is a clear genetic line among
        the early witnesses with Q1 at its head, followed by a derivative Q2 with no
        independent authority, and then the Folio text which is set from an annotated copy
        of Q2 incorporating minor changes apparently from a theatrical manuscript. It has
        not been considered a difficult play.</p>
    <p>Mostly, however, it is the conviction that that Q1 was set directly from authorial
        papers that most insulated it from intense editorial introspection. The various aims
        of editors (and even <em>un</em>editors) essentially converge if the copy-text is a
        reasonably accurate transmission of the author’s final manuscript, particularly if
        the Folio can then be interpreted as affirming that only limited changes were later
        made in the playhouse. But what a wealth of unlikely assumptions are buried in those
        beliefs.††</p>
    <p>Now, twenty-first century scholarship has upset the consensus around both the
        editorial ability to discern the nature of printer’s copy which lies behind this
        genetic line and “the rationale of the copy-text.” These uncertainties substantially
        change the editorial assumptions at play and suggest the need for reëxamining the
        work from a broader perspective.</p>
    <h2>The Nature of the Printer’s Copy</h2>
    <p>The most substantial belief needing reëxamination is the nearly universal hypothesis
        that the printer’s copy underlying Q1 was Shakespeare’s holograph (foul papers)
        manuscript. The recent <em>New Oxford Shakespeare</em> (2016), in a typical example,
        phrases the belief like this: “It has been widely agreed that 1BRADOCK [i.e. Q1] was
        set from the author's papers. Nothing points to a specifically theatrical
        manuscript; there are no actors' names, no duplicated stage directions.” (p.
        863)</p>
    <p>What this wording makes clear is the assumption, relying on a bifurcated
        categorization system established by W.W. Greg, that if the printer’s copy was not
        what we would now call a "promptbook," then the only alternative was that it must be
        authorial papers. Almost from publication of Greg’s theory in his <em>Dramatic
            Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses</em> in 1931, prominent peers,
        especially R. B. McKerrow—who imagined, at minimum, eighteen possibilities for kinds
        of printer’s copy where Greg saw only two—raised concerns that Greg had created a
        false dichotomy. Even Greg, himself, noted that his categorization scheme was
        “perhaps a rash venture.” (p. 191) </p>
    <p>But Greg’s “rash” conception became widely accepted, based on the weight of his
        reputation rather than the evidence he presented, and it heavily influenced
        editorial assumptions well into the current century. Paul Werstein, building on work
        by William B. Long, has now thoroughly discredited Greg’s classification system by
        demonstrating there was never any valid evidentiary basis behind it, but the full
        implications of this are only beginning to be understood (<em>Early Modern
            Theatrical Manuscripts</em>).</p>
    <h3>Theatrical and Literary Manuscripts</h3>
    <p>The <em>New Oxford Shakespeare</em>’s wording reveals another curious assumption.
        It is not at all clear why its editors, along with almost all other modern editors,
        suppose—following Greg—that the basic form of Shakespeare’s rough draft would have
        been a literary manuscript, rather than a performance script for his company.
        Tiffany Stern’s <em>Documents of Performance in Early Modern England</em>
        demonstrates what also seems intuitively obvious, that the standard format for plays
        in this period was as scripts; and probably not even “finished” and artistically
        unified ones in any modern sense, but assemblages of prologues, epilogues, scenes,
        and songs, plus prop letters and pronouncements that were literally read on stage. Far
        from the finely polished product we now imagine, these scripts retained considerable
        flexibility about how they were introduced, concluded, and even what events and
        speeches any given performance might include and to whom they might be assigned.</p>
    <p>While the lack of evidence of a bookholder’s (i.e. prompter's) annotation, such as duplicate stage
        directions or insertion of actors’ names, noted by the <em>NOS</em> editors might
        suggest that the printer’s copy was not what is now called a <em>promptbook</em>
        (although Werstine has shown that the surviving evidence of theatrical manuscripts
        does not support even this conclusion) there is no historic reason for imagining
        that Shakespeare’s draft was therefore not a<em> theatrical</em> manuscript. Not
        even Lucas Erne, whose <em>Shakespeare as a Literary Dramatist</em> has vigorously
        reässerted the literary intentions of the author, suggests that the plays were first
        drafted in the form in which they would ultimately be printed then later
        back-engineered into playing scripts.‡‡</p>
    <p>Sonia Massai has compellingly reasoned that early modern plays were extensively
        (although anonymously) edited for print, which has not been readily apparent only
        because they were “informed by radically different views about what constituted an
        ‘authoritative’ text.” (p. 2) Andrew Murphy, in a way that implies he is simply
        stating the obvious, makes a similar, though understated, assertion that “Every text
        that came to print in quarto needed some element of preparation before it reached
        publication…” (p. 93)</p>
    <p>The most definitive statement of the now questionable view that Q1 represents an
        almost pure authorial draft is found in the 1994 <em>Oxford Shakespeare</em> individual
        edition of the play, edited by Peter Holland. Referring to the printer, he flatly
        states that “Bradock’s compositor(s) worked with a manuscript in Shakespeare’s hand,
        effectively his rough draft, while fair copy made from the draft stayed with the
        Lord Chamberlain’s Men.” (Introduction, p. 113). The long shadow of Greg’s false
        dichotomy is clearly visible, in that Holland again imagines only two possible
        manuscripts, a rough draft that served as printer’s copy and a theatrical copy that
        became the company promptbook. This, however, is only a link in a long chain of
        editors, from John Dover Wilson, Harold Brooks, and R.A. Foakes, to Stanley Wells,
        Gary Taylor and Terri Bourus who have cited essentially the same evidence but
        progressively changed their degree of certainty from speculation into possibility,
        then probability and, with Holland, into statement of fact.§§</p>
    <p>Holland’s argument (which he says is just a simple summary of extensive previous
        discussion) relies on the identification of “incomplete and inconsistent” stage
        directions that he believes (following Greg) “the bookholder, or prompter, at the
        theatre would have needed to be more exact.” (<em>Introduction</em>, p. 114) But
        this is the very evidence about which Werstine has shown Greg was simply wrong.
        Surviving theatrical manuscripts are messy and contain many of the characteristics
        of Shakespeare's printed plays. In fact, <em>MND</em> is the play Werstine uses to
        demonstrate his point (p.130-3).</p>
    <p>Holland’s summary of secondary support for the definitive identification of authorial
        copy rests on a number of putatively distinct Shakespeare spellings in Q1, an
        argument that has always seemed, at best, inconclusive once subjected to rigorous
        statistical analysis, but also has been recently fatally undercut by James Purkis on
        logical grounds (Chap. 5).*** As Purkis has observed, “If Shakespeare’s plays were
        transcribed before they reached print, unraveling the Shakespearean from the
        non-Shakespearean, or the preferred spelling of one agent from another, promises to
        be a barren task. Moreover, it is not necessary to assume that Shakespeare’s plays
        were transcribed fully before printing to pause over attributing an ‘abnormal’
        printed spelling to Shakespeare.” (p. 219)</p>
    <p>The conclusion that spelling evidence can be used to definitively identify holograph
        copy has never been sound, however, unless Shakespeare’s distinctive spellings were
        just idiosyncratic enough to influence compositors setting the play from holograph
        papers, but not odd enough to survive intermediate stages of transmission, like
        scribal copies and theatrical promptbooks.†††</p>
    <p>In summary, the wide-spread certainty in the editorial tradition that the text of
            <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> has come to us almost unmediated from
        Shakespeare’s holograph draft is left not only unsupported, but unsupportable. There
        is, in fact, little reason to believe the quarto (nor, for that matter, the folio)
        text of the play represents even “a close approach to the author’s manuscript,” as
        McKerrow warned us nearly a century ago (p. 7). </p>
    <p>And there are a lot of historical reasons to suspect that it does not. Compared to
        the extant manuscript evidence, like scribal copies of Middleton’s <em>Game of
            Chess</em> vs. Heywood’s holograph theatrical copy of <em>The Captives</em>, it
        certainly looks a lot more like it was made from a copy prepared for a patron/reader
        than from a manuscript that saw practical use in the theatre. This unmooring from
        the dubious authority of the copy-text of choice, and the generally untheatrical
        assumptions hidden behind it, support Tanselle’s procedure of constructing a new
        critical edition from the ground up, not least because it allows a fresh look at a
        significant number of issues of interest to both scholars and practitioners.‡‡‡</p>
    <h2>(ASIDE) Putting the Principles into Practice: A Specific Example</h2>
    <p>It is easy to get caught up in the minutia of theoretical quibbles, but these two
        overarching principles (no designated copy text combined with the aim of recovering
        the work as a theatrical script) make very real differences to this edition. As an
        example, take Unit 39, lines 46-62:</p>
    <div class="example-text">
    <ol>
        <li><strong>“The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung</strong></li>
        <li><strong>By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.”</strong></li>
        <li>We’ll none of that. That have I told my love</li>
        <li>In glory of my kinsman Hercules.</li>
        <li><strong>“The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.”</strong></li>
        <li>That is an old device, and it was play'd</li>
        <li>When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.</li>
        <li><strong>“The thrice-three Muses mourning for the death</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Of learning, late deceas'd in beggary.”</strong></li>
        <li>That is some satire, keen and critical,</li>
        <li>Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.</li>
        <li><strong>“A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus</strong></li>
        <li><strong>And his love Thisbe, very tragical mirth.”</strong></li>
        <li>Merry and tragical? Tedious and brief?</li>
        <li>That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow!</li>
        <li>How shall we find the concord of this discord?</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <p>These lines consist of a series of titles being read off a scroll that has been
        presented to Theseus by the Master of the Revels, and his evaluations of the
        suitability of each as wedding entertainments.</p>
    <p>The bibliographic record from Q1 and F1 is clear, and uncontroversial. In Q1—the
        nearly universal choice for the copy-text—the entire selection is assigned to
        Theseus. He reads the titles aloud, and then comments on each one in turn. F1 prints
        exactly the same words but distributes all the lines that contain titles to
        Lysander, leaving only the commentary on them to Theseus. Since Q1 is perfectly
        clear, and is not obviously in error, according to the standard application of the
        “rationale of the copy-text” this is the solution the editor <em>must</em>
        mechanically accept to avoid falling into the trap of eclectic editing, or mere
        subjectivity.§§§ Indeed, several prominent editors (Foakes, Holland, Chaudhuri)
        explicitly state in their annotations that the alternative found in F1 is more
        theatrically effective, and probably authorial, but nonetheless reject it in
        adherence to copy-text editing practices since it was not (in their opinion) the
        original form.</p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
    <img src="../../images/Folioquarto.2.jpg"
        alt="A Comparison of the sizes of the Folio and Quarto" />
    <p> A 14" tall Folio, next to a Quarto, an Octavo and 2 rare smaller sizes. </p>
</div>
    <p>A small number of editors accept F1’s redistribution of the lines, reasoning they
        result from a theatrical revision that Shakespeare made or approved, which <em>de
            facto</em> makes F1 their copy-text. Whether one treats the section as monologue
        or dialogue, however, is still dependent on a theory of textual transmission
        underlying the choice of copy-text that holds the authorial papers come in a
        literary form and that theatrical choices are the product of later revision.</p>
    <p>Both editing without a copy-text and rejecting the identification of the copy for Q1
        as authorial holograph challenge that theory. Freed from the “tyranny of the
        copy-text,” in two senses, the focus of editorial judgement shifts from
            <em>authority</em> to <em>purpose</em>.</p>
    <p>Thinking about what the work is trying to accomplish (as opposed to what text carries
        the most authority) can clarify that the long-standing binary options are not the
        only two alternatives. Imagining Shakespeare’s draft as a <em>script</em> opens
        another possibility: both witnesses might be attempts to reflect an important
        flexibility of the underlying work that is hard to capture in print and might even
        be pointless in a literary edition.</p>
    <p>The first sixteen lines might have been composed as a unit, earlier than the part of
        the scene that it now follows, without definitive decisions about how it would
        eventually be allocated to speakers. This is, in fact, a perfectly common way for
        both historic and contemporary playwrights—who do not sit down and write their plays
        straight through from beginning to end—to work. Once fitted into the scene, it might
        have been clear that the unit was going to function as dialogue, but there would
        still be no need to specify exactly who feeds the titles to Theseus for his
        commentary, as it makes little difference who reads them to him. (Nothing about them
        makes them character specific: they are not even the “thoughts” of a character but
        just items from a list prepared by someone else.) </p>
    <p>In Elizabethan practice, this open-endedness could be maintained even after the cue
        scripts were prepared, since the crucial lines can be literally read off a prop
        scroll. A decision could wait until after the show was cast, the circumstances of
        production known, and the rehearsal process begun. While such ambiguity serves no
        useful literary purpose, from a theatrical point of view such flexibility is a
        feature, not a bug.</p>
    <p>As to a theory of textual transmission that would explain the witnesses, I propose
        that Q1 was set from a manuscript with these sixteen lines on a discrete page or
        slip that had no speech headings at all.**** (This might have been in Shakespeare’s
        hand, but it is impossible to say since it would look no different if it was a
        transcription.) Even vague familiarity with the plot—or just mythology—would be
        enough for the Q1 compositor to surmise that Theseus is the speaker of the
        commentaries and to provide the speech heading, but in the absence of any stage
        direction it would not be enough to make clear that the titles could or should be
        read by someone else. The compositor could easily overlook that the unit is dialogue. 
        If this is the case then, although not obvious on its surface, Q1 is in error.</p>
    <p>It is uncontroversial that F1 records a specific theatrical staging by Shakespeare’s
        company at some point in which Lysander read the titles to Theseus. I do not believe
        that it records a <em>revision</em> from monologue into dialogue, however. In my
        judgment the selection was always intended as an exchange with one or more of the
        lovers, but having conceptualized it that far, the script was as
        “finished” as the author needed, and perhaps wanted, it to be.</p>
    <p>If the essential quality of the exchange is its playful nature and the building of
        anticipation surrounding the selection of <em>Pyramus and Thisbe</em>, then being
        more specific might even work against the intended effect. The open-ended state of
        the text might well be intentional, in order to foster an element of spontaneity in
        performance.</p>
    <p>If this is true, what does it authorize? Possible theatrical solutions are that the
        Master of the Revels hands the scroll to Lysander, or for that matter, to any one of
        the lovers, to read the first title. That actor might read all four titles, or s/he
        could pass the scroll on to a different actor to read the second title, who might
        similarly keep or pass it. Given that there are four titles proposed and four
        lovers, it does not require a great leap of imagination to envision the possibility
        that each of them reads one. All of these options are controlled by the simple
        passing of a scroll, so it would not have to be worked out in advance and would not
        need to be the same in every performance.</p>
    <p>In fact, redistributing lines is rather standard theatrical practice for this section
        of the play. All of these arrangements of lines have been used effectively in
        numerous stagings. But the thesis here is not that these possibilities <em>can</em>
        work, it is that this is how the script (as opposed to a literary text for readers)
        is <em>supposed</em> to work. It is a textual argument that the original, authorial
        form of the play is as a working model that invites and even requires theatrical
        collaboration, and that the more determined, specified texts are later literary
        adaptations for readers. The editorial tradition has the direction of revision
        backwards. </p>
    <h3>The Extended Implications</h3>
    <p>This lengthy discussion of just a few lines of text would be unjustified if it did
        not have larger implications, as the actual effect on the text of the edition is
        confined to one stage direction and one brief note. Thinking theatrically has
        ripples throughout the edition, however. To give just a few quick examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Throughout the performance of <em>Pyramus and Thisbe</em>, the onstage audience makes a
        series of snarky comments about the performance, which are oddly distributed among the
        speakers. Theseus seems to veer wildly from support to utter disdain for the
        performance, while Hermia and Helena do not speak at all. Given the example of the
        manuscript of <em>Sir Thomas More</em>, where it is clear that similar interjections
        were written without being specifically assigned to speaker until later, it is worth
        questioning when, why and how the speakers were assigned to these lines. </li>
        <li>Two songs in the play distribute the lyrics differently in Q1 and F1, implying
            that they were conceived as being flexible. Rather than decide between these
            alternatives, perhaps a more faithful rendering of the text would leave them
            unassigned.</li>
        <li>Bottom sings snatches of a popular tune in the wood that was certainly not
            specifically composed for the play and could as easily have been Will Kemp’s
            choice as Will Shakespeare’s. Is the best rendering of the script one which
            preserves one specific comic bit, or one that preserves the comedian’s
            prerogative?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Oral Works and Written Texts</h2>
    <p>All of the above points and discussion point to a consideration that should now be
        made explicit. It is important to establish the relationship of <em>texts</em> to
        the underlying <em>work</em>.</p>
    <p>The work of art is the performed (that is, spoken and acted) play. It is meant to be
        communicated orally/aurally in the live theater. It is frustratingly complicated to
        say, conceptually, what any given printed text is in relation to that.†††† We can
        easily start, however, by saying text and work are not identical in the same way
        that we might say a musical score is not a symphony, or a screenplay is not a
        movie.</p>
    <p>Although the cases of musical works and films seem clearer cut to most of us than
        plays, because they do not simultaneously enjoy separate status as works of
        literature, they are closely related. Printed texts of plays are, like them, 
        incomplete, as opposed to texts of poems or novels. They are an attempt to encode and
        transmit a <em>framework</em> for the play in writing, not to replace it.</p>
    <p>Although it is not a precise designation (because plays also contain embodied
        performances, designed sets and costumes, etc.) for the purposes of editing a
        performance script it is useful to approach the work as an <em>oral</em> text. The
        words and lines to be spoken are fundamentally different, and require different
        treatment, than many other formal elements of a written play.</p>
    <p>(As a though experiment, imagine that we had access to a videotape of one of the Lord
        Chamberlain’s Men’s performances, which we are asked to transcribe. The spoken words
        we could recover directly with little disagreement, but things like stage directions
        and speech headings, as opposed to stage action and speech assignments, have no
        material presence in performance. They have to be inferred, and might vary
        widely—especially in form—from one transcriber to the next.)</p>
    <h3>Stage Directions</h3>
    <p>Stage directions are among the most problematic parts of Shakespearean plays. Having
        no manuscripts from the author we are not sure what Shakespeare wrote when drafting
        his plays, but he seems to have thought them out only loosely and may not have
        included anything but the barest indications of actions.</p>
    <p>Ironically, those few directions about which editors generally agree <em>are</em>
        authorial are supported with the argument that they are wrong or misleading—placing 
        entrances incorrectly, for example. One such case is Q1's entrance for
        Helena at the same time that Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius first enter, although
        she plays no part in the ensuing scene. The logic is that only the author still in
        the throes of composition would have created mistaken directions.</p>
    <p>Although occasionally illuminating about the creative process if this was a
        conclusive argument, and it is not, preserving errors—even authorial ones—in no way
        assists production so this edition does not do so.</p>
    <p>Bookholders (the term for stage managers in the period), printers and later editors
        have all created layers of emendation to stage directions, some of which have become
        traditional. These have more accuracy but no authority.</p>
    <p>In keeping with the general principle that this edition should be a practical
        realization of Shakespeare's intent for the stage (as opposed to being bibliographic
        scholarship of its printed history) all stage directions have been rethought from
        scratch. Although quarto or folio directions are sometimes used, stage directions
        should be considered editorial.</p>
    <p>Although this is a departure from standard editorial practice, it is not nearly as
        radical as it may seem. As far back as the eighteenth-century, editors have expressed
        concern about the ability to assess the provenance of the stage directions we have.
        The recent tendency to treat those paratextual elements of the early quartos and folios
        with the same degree of deference as the textual elements, in case they might
        preserve something authorial, is unwarranted. It is their function, and not their
        form, that is their essence.</p>
    <h3>Speech Headings</h3>
    <p>Speech headings throughout the play have been silently regularized. There are some
        interesting variations in the early printed editions, such as “Tyt.” and “Quee.” or
        “Queene” to designate Tytania, but the idea that these are psychologically telling
        about authorial intent—a theory very popular in the late twentieth century—now seems
        unlikely. Printing studies show that type shortages, especially of lower case ys and
        upper case Qs forced compositorial choices about speech headings. As the case for Q1
        being set from holograph papers has fallen apart, it also seems less likely that the
        variations are authorial. Maintaining confusing variations in speech headings
        appears pointless outside of documentary editions. Again, it is their function, and
        not their form, that is their essence.</p>
    <h3>Spelling and Orthography</h3>
    <p>This is a modern spelling rendition, using standard American spelling. A number of
        orthographical considerations come into play, however, about how to render
        rhythmically and metrically important elements of the text on paper. These have led to some
        departures from a typical stylesheet. Even in “Reader Mode” distinctions between
        sounded (ed) and unsounded (‘d) past tense verb endings are preserved. Although once
        very common, this practice has generally fallen out of favor. (Modern editions have
        tended to ignore eighteenth and nineteenth century orthography precedent and opt for
        ease of reading.) It is helpful to reassert precedent for the purposes of this
        edition, however. </p>
    <p>Performer mode directly confronts the problem of how best to represent an oral text
        in print. In “Performer Mode” every effort is made to indicate orthographically all
        elisions and contractions with apostrophes. Sounded past tense verb endings get an
        additional accent mark (èd), as do any unusual accentuations. Expanded endings and
        glide vowels are marked with a dieresis, as in (ïon) endings, words like
        (confërence) when the meter calls for added syllables, and a couple of archaic
        possessives (moonës, nightës). The greatest departure is to repurpose this symbol, a superscript gamma,
        (&#7518;) in places where words—especially names—are combining syllables that are
        sometime separated in modern usage, like (Herm&#7518;a) and (Thes&#7518;us). While
        it is common to treat Hermia and Theseus as three-syllable names, they are
        usually—although not always—treated as two in this play.</p>
    <p>Two other kinds of orthographic rendering have been added, inspired by Edward
        Capell's innovative edition of 1768, which sought to include at least some
        indications of stage business symbolically. Changes of address with speeches are
        marked with a double m-dash (——). Text in <em><strong>bold italic</strong></em>
        indicates a thing or person "pointed to" or indicated. Capell also included a 
        category for props delivered, but these are incorporated into the stage directions 
        in this edition. </p>
    <p>The directly performable words of the play are rendered in serif type, like this:</p>
      <div class="example-text">
        <ol><li>"Shakespeare's words, to be spoken onstage, are in this typeface."</li></ol>
      </div>
    <p>All other aspects of the play, like stage directions, speech headings, and section headers,
      appear in this san serif font.</p>
    <h3> Punctuation </h3>
    <p>Punctuation has been modernized in this edition, also.</p>
    <p> Punctuation in all early modern texts, was inserted by the printing house and not by
        the author. (Indeed, the one fragment of a play that some scholars argue is in
        Shakespeare's handwriting—the "Hand D" section of <em> Sir Thomas More</em>—has
        virtually no punctuation at all.) Grammatical rules for consistent practice did not
        yet exist, so it is relatively arbitrary. </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
    <img src="../../images/HandD.jpg"
        alt="The Hand D addition to SIR THOMAS MORE" />
    <p>A brief addition to <em>Sir Thomas More</em> controversially argued to be in Shakespeare's hand.</p>
</div>
    <p> The usefulness of consulting the quarto and folio editions of the play is that their
        punctuation tends toward the rhetorical and is far less fussy than is modern
        practice. </p>
    <p> Although this edition has silently modernized punctuation throughout, it has done so
        with a bias toward preserving the longer rhetorical phrases, which are so useful to
        actors, over shorter phrases which are intended to illuminate the grammatical
        structure. The semicolon is not the actor's friend. No hesitation has been felt
        about bending modern rules if the resulting choices assist actors to see and feel
        the performance arc of a speech. </p>
    <h3>Structural Divisions</h3>
    <p><em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> has an easily discernable three-part organic
        structure: what happens before the woods, what happens in the woods, and what
        happens after the woods. Traditional act and scene distinctions beyond that are
        simply navigational conveniences to assist with identifying specific moments in the
        work or specific places in the text, and not properties of the work itself. </p>
    <p>For convenience, almost all printed editions of the text incorporate the act
        designations from F1, which were added long after the play was first performed,
        possibly marking pauses used during a revival in a candle-lit indoor venue. While
        these might have been necessary to trim candle wicks at some point, these
        performance breaks are no longer needed, or used, in the modern theater. (In modern
        performance, the play is commonly performed in two parts with an intermission—a.k.a.
        interval—usually taken in the middle of Act III.) </p>
    <p>Most print editions also follow a further division into scenes first used in ROWE,
        which (in the case of <em>MND</em>, not always perfectly) happen whenever there is a full
        clearing of the stage by all actors. </p>
    <p>So long as these divisions are recognized as artificial navigation aids and place
        markers, they are useful. Throughout this edition these traditional markers are
        referenced for these purposes, and for cross-referencing with other editions. They
        should not, however, be conceptualized as either literary or theatrical
        structures.</p>
    <p>This edition is further divided into “French scenes,” because they are the practical
        building blocks of the action, and also the fundamental divisions used in theatrical
        rehearsals. To distinguish them from the traditional “English scenes” that Rowe
        used, these are labelled <strong>Units</strong>. These should be quite useful for
        anyone using this edition practically, but (since literary editions are not intended
        for practical use) are not common in other print editions.</p>
    <h3> Lines and Conventions </h3>
    <p> Verse is recognizable because it is printed in lines that do not run to the right
        margin, and which begin with a capital letter. Prose is printed in a wide column
        with text that runs to the right margin and is most easily recognizable because new
        lines of text do not begin with capital letters. </p>
    <p> Split lines, i.e. single lines of verse shared between two or more speakers, are
        printed with the second speaker's words indented beyond the end of the first's. </p>
    <p> The early texts have some issues with verse lines printed as prose, and <em> vice
            versa</em>, which have been silently corrected in this edition. Most
        importantly, around thirty lines in the play are discernably regular iambic
        pentameter but were not so set in one or more early editions. These are found
        mostly in Units 38 and 39. </p>
    <p>In the fairy’s speech that opens Unit 7, traditional relineation (dating from Pope)
        has been rejected because it implies the lines are written in anapestic dimeter, but
        as explained in the accompanying note, this editor scans the lines in iambic
        tetrameter.</p>
    <h2>Annotation and Commentary</h2>
    <p>This edition is much more heavily annotated and contains far more commentary than
        comparable modern literary editions, possibly because this is a digital edition
        where word counts are not financial considerations. (One of the major purposes for
        creating different user modes, however, is to separate the kinds of notes by purpose
        to avoid information and interface overload.) Some of it, like glossing in “Reader
        Mode” and mythology notes in “Student Mode” should seem familiar. </p>
    <p>In numerous other cases, distinct differences of approach will be seen. Textual notes
        in literary editions, for example, tend to record emendation of the copy text. Such
        notes are tremendously useful, but a serious flaw with most copy-text editing is
        that it hides the degree to which an editor decided <em>not</em> to emend although a
        textual issue exists. Once again bibliography trumped performance.</p>
    <p>It was once quite common, for example, for editors to concern themselves with
        metrical irregularity of lines—assuming that such irregularity probably indicated
        transmission errors. Mid- to late-twentieth century editors became far more
        reluctant to emend even when they considered such errors likely, unless they were
        certain what Shakespeare wrote. But as they began leaving more and more ambiguous
        cases unaltered, they also stopped annotating any instances where meaning was not
        hindered. Perhaps this is fine for readers, but generations of performers have been
        left repeatedly scanning syllables and doubting their own judgment when even blatant
        problems are ignored. Rehearsal halls are stacked with dozens of editions because it
        is often necessary to consult many, many critical editions to find confirmation
        that a crux exists. This edition annotates such metrical irregularity, and often
        offers more than one performance possibility in the notes. Notes are intentionally
        repetitive when the same principal applies as when, for example, the same shortening
        of a name recurs. It is not necessary to consult the notes for every instance once you
        have learned the principle.</p>
    <p>This edition also tries to note instances where performable textual alternatives
        exist in early editions or in the long history of emendation. (By contrast,
        minor—and uncontroversial—bibliographic issues, like typographical errors, are
        silently corrected.) Even when a clear choice has been made for the purposes of this
        edition, it is still useful to the performer to know of viable alternatives.</p>
    <p>Particularly in “Performer Mode” the notes have a decidedly didactic character. Basic
        principles of verse speaking that rely on understanding of underlying scansion are
        always taught separately from the texts to which they apply, so performance students
        are faced with significant hurdles learning how to identify and execute elisions,
        contractions, expansions and accentuation issues. (Literary scansion seems almost
        obsessed with identifying possible spondaic and pyrrhic feet in blank verse lines,
        neither of which exist in pure form in English verse, at the expense of explaining
        how regularly occurring challenges like the “missing v rule” or the “the+vowel rule”
        apply and how these lines are to be spoken.)</p>
        <p>*******************************************************************************</p>
    <h3>Endnotes for "Editorial Principles"</h3>
    <p>*I am avoiding the use of the term “performance edition,” to describe this project
        since that term has already been coöpted to describe other, quite different,
        concepts. Most “performance editions” now on the market, like <em>The Oxford
            Shakespeare</em>, for example, are standard literary editions that simply take
        much more seriously the possibility that changes made to the text in rehearsal and
        performance by the Lord Chamberlain’s Men were either made or approved by
        Shakespeare and are, therefore, authorial. A second category of “performance
        editions,” like the recent <em>Arden 3 MND</em>—which says that both the
        introduction and commentary are designed to present [to readers] the plays as texts
        for performance—contain performance histories, which annotate known or conjectured
        performance choices as a way of illustrating the play, but still have identifiably
        literary aims in doing so. Finally, at least one major edition, <em>The Bedford
            Shakespeare</em>, suggests that its aim, using a lot of illustrations of
        performance history, is to help readers imagine a performance. While all of these
        are valid aims, and while there is room for many different kinds of editions, these
        aims are not what this edition is designed to do. From my perspective they are
        mislabeled in that they are not editions intended for creating performances but
        there is no going back now as these uses of “performance edition” have become
        common.</p>
    <p>†Of course, it is not a new concept to publish a Shakespeare play in the form of a
        script instead of a literary text, but these versions have not been critical editions,
        and quite often are not even particularly scholarly ones. In the converse of the
        “performance editions” described in the previous notes, they are practical
        adaptations (or often just annotations) designed to lead to a specific production or
        records of dramaturgical choices that did lead to a specific production. For
        example, Michael Pennington’s <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream: A User’s Guide</em> is
        a fascinating and deeply illuminating book, but it is a specific reading of the
        literary manuscript, not a critical edition. The recent Arden Performance Editions
        might, at first, seem an exception, but in the case of <em>MND</em>, they do not
        reëdit the text at all, but simply use the literary text established by Harold
        Brooks for the Arden 2nd Series and newly annotate it.</p>
    <p>‡These include historical determinants, including the fact that for nearly three hundred years
            <em>MND</em> was exclusively performed in spectacular musical adaptations that
        bore only a distant relationship to the printed play, so it was literally true that
        the audience for print editions was strictly readers; but they also include simple
        contemporary commercial concerns, like the fact that almost all students in
        secondary and higher education study Shakespeare as literature at some point,
        compared to a much smaller number of students who perform the plays.</p>
    <p>§Tanselle argues, and I accept, that his proposition for displacing copy-text editing
        is not a rejection, but rather the logical extension of W.W. Greg’s core arguments
        in “The Rationale of the Copy-Text” about editorial procedure. Tanselle’s point is
        that Greg does not carry to completion his own arguments for moving away from the
        long-standing “best text” approach in favor of empowering editorial judgment,
        establishing instead a half measure that he had, possibly without realizing it,
        already substantially undercut.</p>
    <p>**Tanselle has said he meant by this that the editor “should not be thinking in terms
        of altering a particular existing text but of building up a new text, word by word
        and punctuation mark by punctuation mark, evaluating all available evidence at each
        step (Millennium, p. 71). Such evidence still includes such standard notions as the
        genetic lineage of early witnesses, and possibly underlying copy, but the editor is
        called upon to evaluate it, rather than mechanically accept the “tyranny of the
        copy-text.”</p>
    <p>††Just a few of these generally anachronistic assumptions are that there was a
        “finished” text, that it was composed in one creative act or revised, if ever, only
        once (as opposed to continuously reworked over a long period of production), and
        that the author’s intent was that it should have a “fixed” form rather than retaining
        flexibility for execution under a variety of circumstances.</p>
    <p>‡‡<em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> is a very poor fit for Erne’s theories in any
        case (as he acknowledges himself in <em>Shakespeare as a Literary Dramatist</em>,
        noting that in several distinct ways <em>MND</em> is an exception to his general
        thesis) but it is not his provocative arguments that are being doubted here. It is
        the simple proposition that even in some counter-factual Gregian universe where
        there <em>were</em> only two kinds of manuscripts, the authorial draft would be the
            <strong>less</strong> theatrical one.</p>
    <p>§§Sukanta Chaudhuri, editor of the most recent major new critical edition, for the
        Arden 3rd Series, retreats somewhat from the rhetoric of certainty other recent
        editors have evidenced. The result, however, is that he tries to have it both
        ways—using more qualifying language and noting weaknesses in all individual stands
        of the long-standing argument, before (rather unconvincingly) concluding that they
        still collectively add up, and again accepting the overall inference.</p>
    <p>***The claim that Holland summarizes relies on an extremely tentative, and
        problematically circular, argument that the so-called “Hand D” addition to the
        manuscript of <em>Sir Thomas More</em> is in Shakespeare’s handwriting because it
        contains distinctive spellings found in print editions of his plays. But then
        adherents attribute to Shakespeare—rather than compositors, scribes, or copyists—the
        distinctive spellings in the printed plays because they are found in “Hand D.”</p>
    <p>†††Chaudhuri makes this argument in the Arden 3rd edition, but his assertion that, “Most
        instances would be altered by scribes and compositors. Hence a few cases, or even
        one, can carry weight,” is not only not supported by evidence, but does not justify
        the conclusion he draws from it.</p>
    <p>‡‡‡This is not to deny that Q1 is the most reliable witness we have. The objections
        of this editor are a matter of degree, not kind. Where previous editors have thought
        it something like a first-hand witness to recent events, I think it more like a
        reporter of hearsay recalled after the passage of several years. Believing that it
        is the <em>best</em> evidence available is not the same as asserting that it is
        especially <em>good</em> evidence.</p>
    <p>§§§ If F1 had printed an unmodified, rather than this slightly modified, version of
        Qq, that there is even an editorial consideration here would now be completely
        invisible.</p>
    <p>****While not a perfect analogy, since it was written, then revised, by many hands, I
        am thinking about the manuscript of <em>The Book of Sir Thomas More</em> as an
        example of a text composed with smaller slips of paper pasted into larger folios,
        and having units of dialogue composed without speech headings.</p>
    <p>†††† As with most editing questions, G. Thomas Tanselle offers insightful and cogent
        explanations about the relationship between <em>texts, versions</em> and
            <em>works</em>. For a more specific discussion of the application of this
        argument to Shakespeare, see W.B. Worthen’s <em>Shakespeare Performance
        Studies</em>.</p>
