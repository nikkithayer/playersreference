<h1>A Brief Performance History</h1>
    
    <p><em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> is the most produced and performed play in the
        world. It has been the perennial champion for decades. This is partially because it
        is by the world’s most popular playwright, William Shakespeare, but it has several
        other distinct performance characteristics that place it ahead of even more read and
        studied titles—like the great tragedies—by the same author.</p>
    <p>As is true of all of the comedies, it enjoys a slight advantage in the professional
        theatre over heavier fare from other genres. It is also an ensemble piece with
        rewarding roles for a large cast that makes it popular in amateur theatres, instead
        of relying on a central starring (and difficult-to-cast) role, like <em>Hamlet</em>,
        for example. And unlike the aged characters of <em>King Lear</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>,
        and most of the history plays, many of the characters of <em>Midsummer</em> are
        adolescents who can be believably portrayed by students in colleges, universities
        and secondary schools. (Indeed, only one character in the play—Hermia’s father,
        Egeus—must logically be characterized as even middle aged.)</p>
    <p>It is also possible to cast far more women in substantial parts than is easily
        possible in most other Shakespeare plays, which also makes it attractive.</p>
    <p>As a result, <em>MND</em> is widely produced in professional theatres, in amateur and
        community theatres, and surges to a huge lead among educational theatres at all
        levels of the spectrum. There are thousands of productions, world-wide, every
        year.</p>
    <p>Little in the play’s early history gave any indication that it would come to dominate
        the theatre as it now does. The title page of the first quarto tells us that it had
        been publicly performed by the theatrical company to which Shakespeare belonged
        “sundry times,” but there are no certain references to exact times and places dating
        from Shakespeare’s lifetime, as there are for most of the canon. (It is possible,
        but far from certain, that “the play of Robin goode-fellow,” which was performed at
        court in January 1604 and mentioned in a contemporary letter was Shakespeare’s play.
        We get no other even plausible reference until 1630, when it was performed at
        Hampton Court.)</p>
    <p>We have to piece together the play’s earliest history conjecturally. Most of
        Shakespeare’s mature plays were clearly conceived for outdoor amphitheatres like the
        Globe, but despite a history of spectacular productions, <em>Midsummer</em> can be
        performed on a virtually empty stage. It does not require anything but a large open
        space with minimal properties for a performance.</p>
    <p>There is a long tradition that the play was commissioned to celebrate an aristocratic
        wedding. There is no solid evidence for this, but the internal subject matter—so
        concerned with nuptial entertainments—does make this seem (somewhat) plausible. It
        could have easily been performed by a touring company in a large hall of an
        aristocratic home of the period or one of the Inns of Court, such as the one
        pictured below, or even outdoors as it often is today.</p>

    <p>Even without believing in this inferred, rather than evidence-based, proposition it
        is reasonable to speculate that the play was written with maximum flexibility in
        mind and not specifically to be performed in one of London's purpose-built
        theaters.</p>
    <p>Given its subject drawn from rural folklore, it is easy to see how it might have been
        imagined originally as material for the humble conditions offered by the central
        courtyards of inns of provincial towns where temporary stages were erected for
        touring performances:</p>

    <p>The reference on the title page of the first quarto suggests that the play was
        eventually performed by the Lord Chamberlain’s Men in some London venue, perhaps The
        Theater or The Curtain, in Shoreditch. It might have moved to the Globe when the
        company built that playhouse in 1599, but that space made possible far more
        sophisticated staging than anything <em>Midsummer</em> requires, and the very fact
        that the play was printed (thus making it available for performance by rival
        companies) in 1600 suggests that it was not a part of the active repertoire.</p>

    <p>At some point later than 1608, when Shakespeare’s company began performing at their
        indoor playhouse, The Blackfriars’, <em>Midsummer </em>was revived in a production
        revised for this space and the emerging new performance conventions of this more
        intimate playhouse. (In addition to the 1630 performance listed above, this
        information can be inferred from the allotment of plays, including <em>A Midsummer
            Night's Dream</em>, to Thomas Killigrew in 1669 based specifically on the fact
        they had been performed at the Blackfriar’s before the Civil War.)</p>
    <p>Act divisions with musical interludes—which were necessary for the trimming of candle
        wicks used for indoor lighting—were added. A stray stage direction ("Tawyer with a
        Trumpet before them.") appearing in the Folio for the first time, which specifically
        names a musician not known to have been a member of the company before 1622,
        suggests that this revival happened well after Shakespeare’s death. The placement of
        the play inconspicuously among the comedies in the Folio again intimates that
        <em>Midsummer</em> was not a particular success upon the occasion of this
        revival.</p>

    <p>After the Restoration the play was revived in a production about which we know
        little, but that diarist Samuel Pepys famously condemned as “the most insipid
        ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life.” Shakespeare’s verbal and imaginatively
        intense comedy was little suited for the tastes of Restoration audiences, who
        preferred a more continental style of theatre, and it soon ceased to be
        performed.</p>
    <p>It was replaced by Henry Purcell’s 1692 opera, <em>The Fairy Queen</em>, and later by
        David Garrick’s 1755 musical (with twenty-eight additional songs) called <em>The
            Fairies</em>. From then until the 19th Century the title was attached to
        performances that cut dialogue extensively, as well as whole sub-plots, but then
        filled out the evening with grand spectacle. Pageants, ballets, children’s choruses
        and a host of sentimental devices reduced the play to a slight fairy tale almost
        without plot. It became traditional for Oberon and Puck to be played by women, and
        the fairies by a <em>corps de ballet</em>. With the advent of illusionistic scenery,
        the backdrops of Greek temples and other classical vistas often became more
        important than the foreground action.</p>

    <p>It was not until Harley Granville-Barker reclaimed the play in an early modern-style
        performance in 1914 that anything like the original play was performed. (It was
        during this roughly three-hundred year period that the editorial tradition of
        treating the plays as literature to be read, rather than performance scripts,
        solidified. It is worth bearing in mind that this legitimately reflected the fact
        that during that long period, Shakespeare editions of <em>Midsummer</em> really were
        not performance scripts. The play was only being staged in variety show adaptations
        that had, at best, tenuous connections to Shakespeare’s original.)</p>

    <p>Throughout the 20th century, this return to an interest in the original text and
        original performance conditions continued side-by-side with more traditionally
        lavish productions like Tyrone Guthrie’s 1937 production at the Old Vic starting
        Vivien Leigh as Titania, accompanied by two dozen ballerina/fairies. Max Reinhardt’s
        1935 film with James Cagney as Bottom and Mickey Rooney as Puck was in this
        spectacular tradition.</p>
    <p>Director Peter Hall staged a ground-breaking version for the Royal Shakespeare
        Company in 1962 (which he turned into a film in 1969, with Judi Dench as Titania)
        placing the play firmly in Tutor England with an emphasis on the dark side of the
        folklore involved.</p>
    <p>It was Peter Brook’s 1970 production for the Royal Shakespeare Company that
        ultimately moved the title to the center of the modern repertoire. Often called the
        most influential Shakespeare production of the 20th Century, Brook’s staging removed
        the last vestiges of the sentimental and spectacular approaches to the play that had
        so long dominated the stage.</p>
    <p>This production was not an early modern re-creation, however. It was reflective of the
        psychedelic, sexually liberated ‘60s. Working with designer Sally Jacobs, the set
        was reduced to a simple white box. Costumes in Athens were “mod” in muted tones, but
        the fairies wore shockingly saturated gowns in primary colors. Oberon’s entrance in
        his blue robe was described by one critic as being so vivid “that you could hear
        it.” The roles of Theseus and Oberon were played by the same actor, as were those of
        Hippolyta and Titania. The supernaturals were clearly the dream doubles of the
        Athenian couple. The production explored the play’s darker themes, especially its
        aggressive and transgressive sexuality. Brook’s <em>Dream</em> not only had no
        children in it, it was not a production to which to bring them. It was also a
        production that set new standards for clear, fresh verse speaking.</p>

    <p>Brook’s shadow has loomed large ever since, with modern productions of the play
        seeking to be experimental, innovative, and respectful of the complexities of the
        text. Many outstanding productions have following in the wake of Brook’s
        <em>Dream</em>, including those of Robert Lepage in 1992 for the Royal National
        Theatre, Adrian Noble for the RSC in 1995, Julie Taymor for Theatre for a New
        Audience in 2013, Dominic Dromgoole at the new Globe reconstruction on London’s
        bankside in 2013 and Emma Rice for the same venue in 2016.  All of these but the
        Lepage production were filmed and are widely available for viewing from numerous
        sources.</p>
    <p>Nicholas Hytner's 2019 production for the Bridge Theatre in London (later shown on NT
Live) essentially exchanged the roles of Oberon and Tytania by reassigning all but the
first few of their lines. He became Bottom's gay paramour because of a magical plot
conducted by her with Puck.</p>
