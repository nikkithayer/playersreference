<h2> Practice Mode </h2>
<p> The final mode in this edition is the <span class="practice-text">olive green "Practice" mode</span>, 
    designed to help with memorizing everything from small chunks to complete roles. </p>
<p> To use this mode, click on the dot in the lower right-hand corner to expand the
    menu, select "Practice" by clicking on its name. Notice that when engaged the dot
    will turn olive green, as will all speech headings in the playscript. </p>
<p> Click on a speech heading for any character once, and all the lines for that
    character will be highlighted. This helps with the beginning stages of memorization.
    Click again on any speech heading of the same character and all lines belonging to
    the character will be hidden. Speech headings, cues and spacing remain. This state
    can be used to test one's memorization. </p>
