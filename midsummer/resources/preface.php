<h1> Preface: A New Kind of Edition </h1>
<blockquote> "Plays exist for one purpose only: to be brought to life... A performance
    should bring the plays, with the audience, to the highest level of life within
    them." Peter Brook (quoted in Rosenbaum) </blockquote>
<p> This edition of <em> A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, although superficially similar
    to other contemporary critical editions, is built on some very different concepts of
    what the <em> purpose </em> of an edition is, what an <em> edition </em> itself is,
    and even what – at the most fundamental level – the underlying <em> work </em> is. </p>
<p> As a result, it differs markedly in tone and substance from most other editions
    currently available. This preface will explore in greater detail what those
    differences are, but in the broadest strokes these can be summarized as
    conceptualizing you not as a literary reader with a predisposition for silent study
    of a fixed artifact, but a "user" with a bias for experiential exploration of a
    potential performance. While it will be particularly useful for actors and
    theatrical practitioners, the idea behind it is that the best way for anyone to
    approach a Shakespearean text is by speaking it aloud and imagining its theatrical
    potential. With just a little guidance, even very young students can successfully
    explore the text and discover it not only through intellectual processes, but by
    feeling its rhythm, shape and power. </p>
<blockquote> "To understand any play text fully you have to speak it." (Patsy Rodenburg) </blockquote>
<p> In addition to the bibliographic concerns (stable text, apparatus, notes and
    glosses) this edition also extensively engages with performance issues. Those
    include scansion, heightened language, current performance practice, and
    contemporary interpretations of the play. All editions attempt to make the play more
    approachable by adopting printing conventions and annotations that clarify the form.
    This one is following that tradition but instead of seeking primarily to make it
    easier to <em> read</em>, the goal here is to make it easier to <em> use</em>. </p>

<h2> What Is an "Edition?" </h2>
<p> To the surprise of many a novice encountering Shakespearean editorial practice for
    the first time, there are no <em> definitive </em> versions of Shakespeare's plays.
    Shakespeare's original handwritten manuscripts have long since disappeared and, in
    fact, may never have existed in the finalized and polished form modern readers
    imagine. We know the work only because of hugely flawed printed copies dating from
    before 1642. These have some claim to direct continuity with Shakespeare or his
    company, but are filled with so many obvious errors, omissions and contradictions,
    that their authority is at best uncertain. </p>
<p> Adding to the confusion, texts of a single title often exist in multiple versions
    that differ markedly from one another. <em> Hamlet</em>, for example, was printed in
    three different versions that feature different words, lines, scenes, scene orders,
    and, in some cases, different character names. The longest of the three is twice the
    length of the shortest. <em> King Lear </em> exists in two versions that differ from
    each other in enough detail that current editorial practice is to treat them as
    separate plays. Other plays show clear signs of revision that complicate -
    literally, necessitate - the editorial task. </p>
<p> An edition is simply the work of an editor (or team of editors) trying to make sense
    of the remaining, often conflicted, evidence in order to make the play(s) accessible
    to contemporary users. Individual editors try to go about this in a variety of ways,
    based upon their assumptions about the relationship of the printed Renaissance
    versions to Shakespeare's manuscripts, as well as their assumptions about the needs
    of current readers.</p>

<h2> What Is a Script? </h2>
<p> At the beginning of Shakespeare's career, plays occupied approximately the same
    "literary" position that television scripts occupy for us. The general public has an
    intense interest in the product, but the standard form of publication (in the most
    fundamental sense of "making public") is performance, not print. Despite the huge
    following many television programs have, most members of the audience have never
    seen a teleplay in print. On rare occasions some such scripts become available as books
    for writers and obsessive fans, but these are a specialty interest. They lack the
    intellectual placement as literature that novels, and even some film scripts, have.
    They are just a way for a small number of screenwriters at the pinnacle of the
    profession to make a few extra bucks off a script after it has been produced. </p>
<p> There is little reason to believe that when <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> was
    originally written Shakespeare had the idea that it would ever see print. When,
    under various circumstances it did, the main reason for the errors, omissions and
    problems they contain is probably that these issues were unresolved in the original
    manuscript. In all likelihood Shakespeare was careless, or rather open-ended, about
    fixing matters that would be worked out in rehearsal anyway. (It made no real
    difference, for example, if in <em> Julius Caesar</em>, he wrote, "I had rather be a
    dog that bays the moon," instead of "I'd rather…" because any skilled actor would
    scan the line and know to contract the first two words.) It is just common sense
    that his time was more valuably spent as an actor preparing performances, from which
    he made his living, or writing the next play, than diligently proofreading a play
    that might expect to receive under a dozen total performances even when it was a big
    hit!</p>
<p> In short, <em>MND</em> was not a manuscript prepared for posterity as a record of
    what happened, or for enduring literary fame. This is hard for contemporary readers
    to grasp because our encounters with plays of all sorts, but especially those of
    Shakespeare, are usually in literature classes where they have become exactly the
    kind of historical documents they were not originally intended to be. Without
    necessarily intending to do so, most editions impose the role of passive observer
    onto the reader. </p>

<h2> What Is a Play? </h2>
<p> If not an historic record, then what is a play? Within the theatrical context, its
    native home, a play is a plan for a future event. It may be a very rough one, or it
    may be a somewhat polished one, but it is never assumed to be a finished product. It
    is not a map of an archeological excavation, but a blueprint for a structure still
    to be built. We all understand that a blueprint is not a building, it is just the
    directions for how to create one. </p>
<p> The best reason for the roughness of plays in Shakespeare's times (like teleplays in
    ours) is that the initial script is just the first step in a collaborative process.
    A host of other people, including producers, actors, directors, designers and
    technicians (and not infrequently co-authors and script doctors) are involved in
    order to bring the script "to life." This was as true of Shakespeare as it was of
    other playwrights in his time, and is still true of writers of teleplays in ours.
    The only difference, as scholar Stephen Orgel has pointed out, is that as a co-owner
    of the theater company and an actor in his own plays, Shakespeare was in on more
    parts of the collaboration than comparable authors (<em>Authentic Shakespeare</em> 84). </p>

<h2> Where <em> You </em> Come In </h2>
<p> This edition attempts to restore the implicit assumption that the user is not a
    passive reader, but will become an active collaborator. It treats the theatrical
    event as fulfillment, not debasement, of the raw materials. </p>
<p> Although the Users' Guide will explore these concepts in far greater detail, here
    are quick indicators of a few of the ways this edition does so: </p>
<p> The elasticity of the English language is foregrounded so that the speaker (even if
    she is a student studying the work) can actively explore the rhythmic effect of the
    verse lines, and feel the actor's part in creating it. Every attempt is made to ease
    sight-reading the play aloud, instead of perpetuating print conventions. </p>
<p> Stage directions, even historically interesting ones that possibly came directly
    from Shakespeare, are modified into practical and accurate modern forms. For
    example, the wonderfully evocative "Enter a Fairy at one door, and Robin Goodfellow
    at another" is changed to "Enter a Fairy and Puck from opposite directions" because
    modern productions are highly unlikely to have doors in their "forests." </p>
<p> Notes on the text emphasize modern performance practice over historic explanation.
    Although it is interesting to know how early modern audiences might have experienced
    the plays, we cannot undo the viewpoint of audiences of our time with footnotes.
    This is especially true with issues of race, class and gender. For example, when
    Lysander spurns Hermia with the racial epithets, "Ethiope" and "tawny Tartar," many
    modern audience members are, justifiably, offended. How such challenges are
    addressed in modern performance becomes the focus of the note in this edition,
    rather than the usual historic contextualizing of these as mere rhetorical figures. </p>
