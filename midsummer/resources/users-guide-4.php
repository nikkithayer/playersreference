<h2> Student Mode, with Notes, Mythology, and Textual Variants </h2>
<p> <span class="student-text">Blue "Student" mode</span> is designed to assist a user who has advanced beyond determining the
    basic meaning of the words, and is placing them in context. In this mode, some words
    in the text appear in blue - indicating that they are annotated. Clicking directly
    on the word(s) will access the note. In general, these are more interpretive in
    nature. Notes come in three types: </p>
<p>
    <strong> Explanatory Notes </strong> - These notes are more informational than
    instantly practical, meant to bring attention to aspects like interesting
    interpretive possibilities in the play, topical references and specifics of
    production history. Where appropriate, illustrations may be provided to make the
    visual implications more concrete. </p>
<p>
    <strong> Mythological References and Classical Allusions </strong> – One of the
    reasons that Shakespeare often seems difficult for contemporary actors and audiences
    to understand is the extensive references he makes to classical Greek and Roman
    literature, including mythology. These notes about classical allusions in the play
    are intended to elucidate the references, themselves, and the emotional or symbolic
    significance they might have held for Shakespeare's audience. </p>
<p>
    <strong> Textual Alternatives </strong> - The final type of note is the most
    esoteric – the textual alternative, or variant: </p>
<p> Notes with a title line of "Textual Alternative" indicate that there is a viable
    alternative reading available–which was not adopted for this edition–but about
    which the reader/performer may wish to know. The notes elucidate cases where modern
    editors disagree about what the original wording was, or where authorial revision
    might have provided another option. </p>
<p> Notes about textual alternative take this form: </p>
<span class="half-line"> wanes] Q2 &amp; F; waves Q1 </span>

<p> The reading adopted in this edition is indicated in front of the square bracket.
    Behind the bracket is an indication of the source of this reading. After the
    semi-colon, the alternative reading follows, along with an indication of the
    Renaissance edition(s) that include(s) it. The abbreviations used in these notes
    are: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Q1 = First quarto of 1600. </li>
    <li> Q2 = Second quarto of 1619. </li>
    <li> Qq = Both first and second quartos. </li>
    <li> QF = Both first quarto and first folio. </li>
    <li> QqF = Both quartos and first folio
    <li> F = First folio of 1623. </li>
    <li> F2 = Second folio of 1632. </li>
    <li> Proper names indicate the eighteenth-century, or later, editor first
        responsible for the adopted reading. These are sometimes associated with 
        a series or publisher name, like <em>The Oxford Shakespeare</em>. </li>
