<h1> Quick Start Guide </h1>
<p> The <em> Experiential Shakespeare </em> operates in four basic modes. Upon opening
    the app a colored dot appears in the bottom right corner of the screen, which can be
    clicked to expand the modes menu. Clicking any one of the mode names will display
    the playscript in that mode. The dot will change to the color of the current mode. </p>
<p> Clicked once, the <font color="red">red "Reader" mode</font> provides the
    basic edited text. Clicking it a second time turns the mode name purple, and begins
    displaying the text with line numbers and interlinear textual glosses in small red
    type. This allows the beginning reader to get an instant sense of the content of the
    line without losing her place, and without resorting to modern paraphrase. </p>
<p> The <span class="student-text">blue "Student" mode</span> switches to the basic text
    with annotated words and phrases rendered in <span class="student-text">blue
        type</span>. Notes can be accessed by clicking directly on the word or phrase.
    The full note will scroll up from the bottom of the page. Clicking on the [X] which
    appears behind the word or phrase will make the note disappear. Notes in this
    section include critical insights, explanations of mythological references and
    classical allusions, and editorial elucidations of textual variants. </p>
<p> The <span class="performer-text">emerald green "Performer" mode</span> is designed
    to assist the oral delivery of the text by displaying significant rhythmic
    (scansion) issues in <span class="performer-text">green text</span>, and wherever
    possible indicating with typographic symbols the expansions or contractions
    necessary to maintain the iambic meter. As in the "Student" mode, the full note can
    be accessed by clicking on the word(s). Notes contain an explanation of what the
    scansion issue is, an indication of contemporary performance practice, a loose
    rendering using a dictionary-style phonetic system, and a more exact rendering in
    the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). This mode also includes indications of
    exemplary rhetorical devices using interlinear text like "Reader" mode. Of course,
    virtually every line in Shakespeare's plays employs some classical rhetorical
    strategy, so only a few prototypical devices can be featured, but these will serve
    to give a novice performer some idea of the nature of the oratorical assistance
    built into the speeches. </p>
<p> Finally, the <span class="practice-text">olive green "Practice" mode</span> provides
    a basic text. Clicking once on a speech heading will highlight all of that
    character's lines in the entire play. Clicking twice will hide the character's
    lines. This mode can be used to assist the early and intermediate stages of
    memorizing lines. </p>
<p> Clicking on the vertical black bar in the right margin will open a full Table of
    Contents giving access to all supporting materials, and making quick navigation
    possible. Clicking again will close the menu. </p>
<p> To begin using the app, simply scroll down the page until the text begins. To read
    the prefatory materials first, click on the button below instead. </p>
